and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.7.2] - 2026-06-05

Extends the style guard to corporate jargon, and restructures SKILL.md for
token efficiency via progressive disclosure. No behaviour changes.

### Added

- `tools/lint-style.sh` now also fails on the four banned corporate-jargon
  words, filtered through `tools/style-allowlist.txt`. The allowlist
  permits lines documenting the rule itself, plus the established term
  "user journey". The em-dash check now lives in the same script, which
  `npm run lint:style` calls.
- `help/arguments.md` (full flag reference) and `help/references.md` (the
  reference-file and template catalogue), loaded on demand.

### Changed

- **SKILL.md slimmed from 651 to 195 lines (~70%)** by relocating the
  command catalogue, argument reference, workflow diagrams, and reference
  index out of the always-loaded router into lazy-loaded `help/help.md`,
  new `help/arguments.md`, and new `help/references.md`. This cuts the
  per-invocation context cost with no feature loss: all 153 command
  strings and 55 flags are verified present in the relocated files. The
  Progressive Loading Guide gains routing rows for the new files.
- Reworded two metaphorical jargon uses (operator-heuristics, lessons
  help) to plainer wording; these were not allowlist candidates.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-06-05

Style and tooling housekeeping. No content or behaviour changes.

### Fixed

- Replaced 201 em-dashes across the skill docs, templates, lessons,
  README, CHANGELOG, and CLAUDE.md with spaced en-dashes, per the
  house style rule in CLAUDE.md. The v1.7.0 content reintroduced them
  because no automated check existed.
- Corrected a stale line-count note in CLAUDE.md (SKILL.md is 651
  lines, not 584).

### Changed

- `npm run lint` now also runs a style guard (`lint:style`) that fails
  on any em-dash in markdown, so the regression cannot recur. CI picks
  this up automatically via the existing `npm run lint` step.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-05

Field-tested patterns from real-world use, generalised and folded back
into the skill. This release adds a design-exploration artifact type,
an operating doctrine for onboarding, a cross-project lessons registry,
and hardening of the reconcile, review, and release workflows. The
v1.6.0 Python helper scripts are unchanged.

### Added

- **RFC artifact type** (`/sdlc-studio rfc`): a first-class artifact for
  exploring an unsettled design space *before* committing to a CR.
  Lifecycle: create, list, review, accept (spawns CRs), close
  (supersede/withdraw). Ships with `reference-rfc.md`, `help/rfc.md`, and
  `templates/core/rfc.md` + `templates/indexes/rfc.md`. RFCs share the
  cross-repo numbering guard with CRs.
- **Operating doctrine** (`reference-doctrine.md`): a project-agnostic
  manual for onboarding a Claude to any sdlc-studio project - the skill as
  an OS, the RFC/CR/ADR decision matrix, files-as-truth and reconcile
  discipline, review cadence, consult gates, TDD default, paperwork in the
  same commit, lessons recall, and cross-repo numbering. Surfaced from
  `/sdlc-studio init`.
- **Cross-project lessons registry** (`lessons/`): a release-curated set of
  generalisable engineering/process lessons (seeded with six) that any
  project can recall before substantive decisions, distinct from a
  project's own transient `.local/lessons.md`. Recall and promote hooks
  documented in `help/lessons.md` and `reference-agentic-lessons.md`.
- **Operator heuristics** (`reference-operator-heuristics.md`): cross-cutting
  patterns for running a live service alongside development - hypothesis
  discipline, memory-entry drift, silent-CLI/proxy failure localisation,
  bug-title framing, external-layer-first diagnosis, post-release briefing,
  and adversarial review as a release gate.
- **Deploy readiness patterns** (`reference-deploy-readiness.md`): platform-
  agnostic post-deploy verification - cold-spawn pre-warm, smoke budget
  sizing, auto-rollback on smoke fail, readiness-wait protocol, and soak
  windows.
- **Plan-file lifecycle** (`reference-plan-files.md`): conventions for
  Claude Code plan files (`~/.claude/plans/`) - active vs archived layout,
  listing, archiving, and anti-patterns.
- **Persona review**: `/sdlc-studio review` now reviews personas (staleness
  map, PRD/CR cross-checks, self-consistency), scans `sdlc-studio/rfcs/`,
  supports `--skip-personas`, and writes a unified `reviews/LATEST.md`
  first-read anchor (`templates/reviews/unified-anchor.md`).
- **Reconcile census + cadence**: reconcile now rebuilds each index from an
  on-disk file census (detecting status mismatch, missing rows, and orphan
  rows), adds RFC scope, detects numeric-claim drift in prose docs
  (report-only, or auto-fix with `--fix-counts`), and emits advisory
  cadence triggers (epic close, ship, CR action, 7-day window) tracked in
  `reconcile-state.json`.
- **Release strategy**: `release_strategy` config (`solo-dev | pr-required |
  staged-rollout`) plus a decision tree (`reference-decisions.md`) that
  branches ship guidance accordingly.
- **Execution contract**: `reference-decisions.md` defines stop conditions
  and anti-patterns for agentic execution after plan approval.
- **Multi-persona pressure-test canvas** (`reference-consult.md`): a
  structured pattern for consulting multiple personas in parallel on
  high-blast-radius design decisions.
- **Verification depth tiers** and **test-timeout tuning** discipline
  (`reference-test-best-practices.md`), recorded per AC and at bug close;
  rollback envelope and per-AC verification target in `reference-story.md`.
- **Release-gate checklist** template (`templates/workflows/release-gate.md`)
  and new config knobs: `personas.staleness_days`, `contract_tables`.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-04

Structural upgrades from competitive research against BMAD-METHOD,
GitHub Spec Kit, Kiro, and Aider. Four new capabilities target the
real pain points: agent prompts that hallucinate files, acceptance
criteria that drift from reality, the skill as a parallel universe
to GitHub Issues, and projects that start dumb every time.

### Added

- **Scripts directory convention**: `.claude/skills/sdlc-studio/scripts/`
  now holds skill-internal Python helpers invoked by workflows.
  Documented in `reference-scripts.md`. Ships with three scripts,
  all pure-Python stdlib except where noted, all with unit tests
  runnable via `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests`.
- **AST Repo Map** (`scripts/repo_map.py`): indexes source files
  by symbols and imports, ranks files by relevance to a story
  description. Supports Python (via stdlib ast), TypeScript,
  JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, Kotlin, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift via
  regex extractors. Subcommands: `build`, `query`, `stats`. Output
  at `sdlc-studio/.local/repo-map.json`. The Agent Prompt Template
  now derives its `READ THESE FILES FIRST` list from repo_map
  query output instead of hand-authoring from memory.
- **Executable Acceptance Criteria** (`scripts/verify_ac.py`): AC
  blocks in story files gain optional `Verify:` and `Verified:`
  bullets. `/sdlc-studio reconcile --verify` runs each verifier
  and updates state in place. DSL supports `pytest`, `jest`,
  `vitest`, `go`, `file`, `grep`, `http ... -- <jq>`, and `shell`
  as fallback. Report written to
  `sdlc-studio/.local/verify-report.json`. Story Completion Cascade
  gains an optional gate (`require_ac_verification: true` in
  config) that blocks Done unless every AC reports `Verified: yes`.
- **GitHub Issues Sync** (`scripts/github_sync.py`): two-way sync
  between local CR / Story / Epic files and GitHub Issues via the
  `gh` CLI. Unified model: a CR and its linked Issue are two
  representations of the same record. Subcommands: `push`, `pull`,
  `cascade`, `state`. Label convention uses `sdlc:` prefix. Every
  record template gains a `> **GitHub Issue:**` metadata line.
  reference-cr.md gains a full `/sdlc-studio cr sync` workflow.
  Story Completion Cascade gains step 12 to update linked issues
  on status transitions.
- **Per-Project Lessons**: `sdlc-studio/.local/lessons.md`
  accumulates project-specific failure patterns across agentic
  runs. Loaded at every wave start and injected into Agent Prompt
  Templates as a `Known Pitfalls on This Project` section.
  reference-agentic-lessons.md gains a "Lessons Accumulation"
  section with the file format, four hook points (wave failure,
  post-wave merge failure, epic retrospective, manual add), and
  consumption pattern. `/sdlc-studio lessons list|add|prune`
  commands.
- **Windows PowerShell installer** (`install.ps1`): one-line install
  via `irm ... | iex`, mirroring `install.sh`. Supports `-Local`,
  `-Global`, `-DryRun`, `-Version <tag>`, and `-Help`. README gains
  Windows instructions throughout.

### Changed

- **Verifier DSL** (`reference-verify.md`): new document defining
  the executable-AC DSL, writing guidance, troubleshooting, and
  integration with reconcile.
- **`reference-reconcile.md`**: Phase 2 gains check h) AC
  verification drift. Scope table gains `verify` row that
  delegates to `scripts/verify_ac.py`.
- **`reference-outputs.md`**: Story Completion Cascade gains step
  0 (AC verification gate, conditional on config flag) and step 12
  (external sync push for records with a `GitHub Issue:` field).
- **`reference-cr.md`**: new `/sdlc-studio cr sync - Step by Step`
  workflow inserted between `cr review` and `cr close`.
- **`reference-epic.md`**: Agent Prompt Template instructs authors
  to derive `READ THESE FILES FIRST` from repo_map query output.
  Wave prep loads `.local/lessons.md`. Handle Story Errors appends
  a lesson on failure.
- **`reference-code.md`**: code plan step 6 explicitly runs
  repo_map build + query before the Explore agent.
- **`reference-agentic-lessons.md`**: READ THESE FILES FIRST
  guidance references repo_map. New "Load project lessons before
  exploration" subsection. New "Lessons Accumulation" section at
  end of file.
- **`reference-story.md`**: story-create step 3g emits best-effort
  Verify lines matching AC type.
- **`templates/core/story.md`**: AC blocks gain Verify and
  Verified bullets. Metadata gains `GitHub Issue:` field.
- **`templates/core/cr.md`**, **`templates/core/epic.md`**: both
  gain a `GitHub Issue:` metadata field.
- **`templates/config-defaults.yaml`**: new
  `require_ac_verification: false` gate.
- **`SKILL.md`**: new "Utilities" and "External Integrations"
  command sections. Progressive Loading Guide rows for
  repo-map, verify, github-sync, scripts, and lessons.
- **`help/*.md`**: new help files for repo-map, verify,
  github-sync, lessons. Existing `help/reconcile.md` documents
  `--verify`, `--story`, and `--scope verify` arguments.
- **Templates**: pre-existing markdownlint drift in
  `templates/core/story.md` cleaned up while adding Verify fields.
- **Script hardening**: the three scripts gain release-grade
  robustness: malformed `gh` output and corrupt sync state no longer
  crash `github_sync.py` (graceful fallback), `verify_ac.py` clamps
  out-of-bounds insertion points, all file I/O is explicit UTF-8, and
  every public function is documented. Test suite grows to 46 cases
  covering the new edge paths.

### Config

- `templates/config-defaults.yaml` adds `require_ac_verification`
  (default `false`). Flip to `true` once reconcile reports zero
  manual ACs to enable the Story Completion Cascade gate.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-14

Production-run upgrades to the SDLC pipeline. Four new commands, a
formal Three Amigos review model, project-wide orchestration, and
mechanical drift reconciliation. All additions are backwards
compatible with v1.4.0 artefacts.

### Added

- **Change Requests**: `/sdlc-studio cr` lifecycle for post-PRD changes
  - `cr create`, `cr list` (filter by status, priority, type, affects),
    `cr action` (bridges a CR into epics and stories and updates the
    PRD feature inventory), `cr review` (staleness and cascade
    checks), `cr close` (Complete, Rejected, Deferred)
  - New files: `reference-cr.md`, `help/cr.md`, `templates/core/cr.md`,
    `templates/indexes/cr.md`
  - Stored at `sdlc-studio/change-requests/CR{NNNN}-{slug}.md`
- **Project-Level Orchestration**: `/sdlc-studio project plan` and
  `/sdlc-studio project implement`
  - Dependency-graph execution across all epics with topological sort
    and cycle detection
  - Flags: `--agentic`, `--from epics|stories`,
    `--commit-strategy per-wave|per-epic|per-project`, `--resume
    EP000X`, `--skip EP000X`, `--no-artifacts`, `--dry-run`
  - Persistent state at `sdlc-studio/.local/project-state.json` with
    epic-by-epic checkpoints
  - Quality gates at wave, epic, and project boundaries
  - New files: `reference-project.md`, `help/project.md`
- **Reconciliation**: `/sdlc-studio reconcile [--dry-run] [--scope
  stories|epics|prd|crs|indexes]`
  - Mechanical drift detection and repair across stories, epics, PRD
    feature statuses, CRs, indexes, dependency tables, and checkbox
    state
  - Idempotent; runs automatically at epic and wave boundaries during
    agentic execution
  - New files: `reference-reconcile.md`, `help/reconcile.md`
- **Agentic Lessons**: `reference-agentic-lessons.md` captures
  production-tested patterns for wave execution, exploration cadence,
  hub-file sidecar pattern, per-wave reconcile, commit pacing, and a
  failure-mode table. Loaded before any `--agentic` wave execution.
- **Three Amigos Consultation**: formal PM/Eng/QA review model now the
  default for epic create, story create, story plan, and bug fix.
  Personas named (Sarah Chen, Marcus Johnson, Priya Sharma) with
  distinct review remits.

### Changed

- **`reference-outputs.md`**: canonical 11-step Story Completion
  Cascade (previously 6) and 9-step Epic Completion Cascade. All other
  reference files now delegate to this file rather than maintaining
  local copies. Adds compressed status flow (Ready -> Done) for
  agentic batch mode and documents the `project-state.json` artefact
  and the `Owner` field on stories.
- **`reference-epic.md`** (+50%): Three Amigos mandatory review,
  8-step Post-Wave Merge Protocol with troubleshooting table, full
  Agent Prompt Template (READ FIRST, DO NOT, AC-to-files mapping, code
  snippets for shapes not logic), wave-boundary quality gates,
  `--no-artifacts` agentic mode.
- **`reference-review.md`** (+50%): automatic Phase 3a persona
  consultation, Phase 3b auto-apply mechanical fixes (with `--no-fix`),
  Phase 4 review-state.json update, test-tree validation against TSD,
  CR staleness checks.
- **`reference-workflow-personas.md`**: defaults flipped from Optional
  to Always for most artefacts; new sections for story-plan and
  bug-fix consultation.
- **`reference-story.md`**: Three Amigos default review, new Agentic
  Mode Behaviour section covering `--no-artifacts`.
- **`reference-code.md`**: Three Amigos plan review; completion
  checklist expanded from 6 to 12 steps.
- **`reference-bug.md`**: Three Amigos for bug fixes (impact, root
  cause, regression).
- **`reference-prd.md`**: automatic persona consultation when
  `sdlc-studio/personas/` exists.
- **`reference-tsd.md`**: review-state.json fallback to `RV*.md` scan
  with explicit reviews-health formula.
- **`reference-config.md`**: project implement configuration block
  (`commit_strategy`, `review_interval`, `auto_reconcile`,
  `auto_commit`).
- **`reference-consult.md`**: automation table with Three Amigos as
  the explicit default across most artefacts.
- **`SKILL.md`**: registers new commands and flags, adds
  Reconciliation, Change Management, and Project Implementation
  sections.
- **`help/help.md`**: Change Management, Project Implementation, Epic
  Implementation, Story Implementation, and manual Development Cycle
  sections.
- **`help/status.md`**: dual-source metrics with `RV*.md` fallback
  when `.local/review-state.json` is absent.

### Config

- `.markdownlint.json`: set `MD046` to fenced style and disable
  `MD036` (the skill deliberately uses bold labels as sub-step markers
  within numbered lists).
