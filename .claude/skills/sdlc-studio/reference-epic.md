## Epic Workflows

## /sdlc-studio epic - Step by Step {#epic-workflow}

1. **Check Prerequisites**
   - Verify PRD exists at sdlc-studio/prd.md
   - Create sdlc-studio/epics/ if needed
   - Scan for existing epics to determine next ID

2. **Parse PRD**
   - Extract Feature Inventory section
   - Extract Problem Statement for context
   - Note dependencies between features

3. **Group Features into Epics**
   Heuristics:
   - Features sharing user type → same Epic
   - Features with shared dependencies → same Epic
   - Features forming a complete user flow → same Epic
   - Maximum 5-8 features per Epic

4. **Generate Epic Files**
   For each Epic:
   - Assign ID: EP{NNNN}
   - Create slug (kebab-case, max 50 chars)
   - Use `templates/core/epic.md`
   - Fill all sections from PRD data
   - Estimate story points
   - **Status Rules:**
     - New epics → "Draft"
     - After review/approval → "Ready" or "Approved"

     > **Source of truth:** `reference-decisions.md` → Status Transition Rules

5. **Write Files**
   - Write `sdlc-studio/epics/EP{NNNN}-{slug}.md`
   - Create/update `sdlc-studio/epics/_index.md`

6. **Report**
   - Number of Epics created
   - List with IDs and titles
   - Orphan features (if any)

7. **Three Amigos + Stakeholder Assessment (Default)**
   Unless `--skip-personas` flag used, run Three Amigos review plus affected stakeholder consultation:

   a. **Three Amigos review each epic for:**
      - **Sarah Chen (PM):** Scope boundaries, success metrics, user value, feature completeness
      - **Marcus Johnson (Eng):** Technical feasibility, TRD alignment, architecture impact, dependency accuracy
      - **Priya Sharma (QA):** Testability, risk assessment, TSD alignment, quality gate applicability

   b. **Affected Stakeholder review:**
      - For each Epic, identify affected personas from:
        - Personas mentioned in PRD features
        - Personas whose pain points are addressed
        - Personas whose workflows are impacted
      - Populate "Affected Personas" section in each Epic
      - Consult affected stakeholder personas for domain-specific feedback

   c. **Apply findings:**
      - Update epic AC with improvements from Three Amigos
      - Add persona-raised concerns to Risks section
      - Update revision history with consultation attribution
      - Report persona impact assessment:
        - Primary beneficiaries
        - Potentially affected stakeholders
        - Concerns raised by personas
        - Changes applied

## Perspective-Based Generation {#perspective-based-generation}

Use `--perspective` to generate epics with specific focus areas aligned to document types. This creates a consistent mental model:

- **Product perspective** → PRD-style breakdown (features, user value)
- **Engineering perspective** → TRD-style breakdown (technical architecture)
- **Test perspective** → TSD-style breakdown (quality strategy)

### Engineering Perspective (--perspective engineering) {#perspective-engineering}

Aligns with TRD - generates epics emphasising technical structure.

**Additional sections per epic:**

| Section | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Components | Component boundaries and ownership |
| API Contracts | Endpoints, methods, schemas |
| Data Models | New/modified entities and relationships |
| Infrastructure | Infrastructure requirements |
| Tech Dependencies | Libraries, services, versions |
| Performance | Performance considerations and targets |
| Security | Security implications and mitigations |

**Story emphasis:** Technical implementation details, API specifications, data schemas.

**Example output:**

```markdown
### Engineering View (TRD-aligned)

**Components:**
- UserAuthService: Handles authentication flows (Owner: Backend Team)
- SessionManager: Manages session lifecycle (Owner: Backend Team)
- AuthMiddleware: Request authentication (Owner: Platform Team)

**API Contracts:**
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login`: Authenticate user credentials
- `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`: Refresh access token
- `DELETE /api/v1/auth/logout`: Invalidate session

**Data Models:**
- User: id, email, password_hash, created_at, last_login
- Session: id, user_id, token_hash, expires_at, ip_address

**Technical Dependencies:**
- bcrypt (14.0): Password hashing
- jsonwebtoken (9.0): JWT creation/verification
- redis (4.6): Session storage
```

### Product Perspective (--perspective product) {#perspective-product}

Aligns with PRD - generates epics emphasising business value.

**Additional sections per epic:**

| Section | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User Value | Clear statement of user benefit |
| Success Metrics | Measurable outcomes with baselines and targets |
| Priority Rationale | Why this order? Business justification |
| Stakeholder Impact | Who is affected and how |
| Release Considerations | Timing, dependencies, rollout strategy |
| Business Risk | Risk if delayed or not delivered |

**Story emphasis:** User benefits, acceptance criteria from user perspective.

**Example output:**

```markdown
### Product View (PRD-aligned)

**User Value:** Users can securely access their accounts with minimal friction, reducing support tickets by 40%.

**Success Metrics:**
| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Login success rate | 87% | 95% |
| Password reset requests | 50/day | 20/day |
| Support tickets (auth) | 25/week | 10/week |

**Priority Rationale:** Authentication is foundational - blocks user profile, settings, and personalisation features. Delivery in Q1 unblocks Q2 roadmap.

**Stakeholder Impact:**
| Stakeholder | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| End Users | New login flow | Gradual rollout, clear guidance |
| Support | Training needed | Documentation, FAQs |
| Marketing | Can promote security | Press release coordination |
```

### Test Perspective (--perspective test) {#perspective-test}

Aligns with TSD - generates epics emphasising quality assurance.

**Additional sections per epic:**

| Section | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Test Types Required | Unit, integration, E2E with coverage targets |
| Risk-Based Priorities | What to test first based on risk |
| Test Data Requirements | What data needed for testing |
| Automation Candidates | What can/should be automated |
| Manual Testing Needs | What requires human verification |
| Performance Scenarios | Load, stress, endurance tests |

**Story emphasis:** Test scenarios, edge cases, failure modes.

**Example output:**

```markdown
### Test View (TSD-aligned)

**Test Types Required:**
| Type | Coverage Target | Automation |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Unit | 90% | Fully automated |
| Integration | 80% | Fully automated |
| E2E | Critical paths | Automated |
| Security | OWASP Top 10 | Automated scans + manual |

**Risk-Based Priorities:**
1. Session hijacking prevention - High risk - Security scan + penetration test
2. Password brute force - High risk - Rate limiting tests
3. Token expiration - Medium risk - Automated timing tests
4. Concurrent logins - Medium risk - Load testing

**Test Data Requirements:**
- users_valid: 100 valid user accounts with various states
- users_locked: 20 accounts in locked state
- tokens_expired: Pre-generated expired tokens for testing

**Automation Candidates:**
- Login flow happy path (E2E)
- Token refresh cycle (Integration)
- Password validation rules (Unit)
- Rate limiting behaviour (Integration)
```

## /sdlc-studio epic review - Step by Step {#epic-review-workflow}

Epic review now **cascades by default** - it reviews the epic and all changed stories/code. Use `--quick` for epic-only review.

### Command Syntax

```bash
/sdlc-studio epic review              # Cascade review (default) - epic + changed stories
/sdlc-studio epic review --quick      # Quick review - epic only, skip stories
/sdlc-studio epic review --resume     # Resume from last pause point
/sdlc-studio epic review --epic EP0001  # Target specific epic
```

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--quick` | Skip cascade, review only the epic |
| `--resume` | Resume from where review paused |
| `--epic EP0001` | Target specific epic |

### Cascade Workflow (Default) {#cascade-workflow}

```text
1. Build Review Queue
   - Load target epic
   - For each linked story:
     - Check: story spec changed since review?
     - Check: story code changed since review?
   - Add changed items to queue
   - Prioritise: failing tests > spec changes > code changes

2. Execute Reviews
   For each queue item:
   - Story spec: Check AC against implementation
   - Story code: Run code review patterns
   - Store findings in RV{NNNN} file
   - Update .local/review-state.json timestamps

3. Aggregate Epic Review
   - Compile story findings
   - Check epic-level AC
   - Generate summary

4. Report
   - Display findings by severity
   - List actionable items
   - Show what was reviewed vs skipped
```

### Step-by-Step (Cascade Mode)

1. **Load Epic and Build Queue**
   - Read target epic from sdlc-studio/epics/
   - Parse acceptance criteria and story links
   - Load `.local/review-state.json` for modification tracking
   - Build review queue:

     ```text
     For each linked story:
       if needs_re_review(story_spec): add story_spec to queue
       if code_changed_since_review(story): add story_code to queue
     ```

   - Save queue to `.local/review-queue.json` for resume capability

2. **Execute Story Reviews**
   For each item in queue:
   - **Story spec review:**
     - Check AC against implementation
     - Verify edge cases handled
     - Check for regressions
   - **Story code review:**
     - Run code quality checks
     - Check for pattern violations
     - Verify test coverage
   - Store findings in `sdlc-studio/reviews/RV{NNNN}-{story-id}-review.md`
   - Update `.local/review-state.json` with review timestamp

3. **Check Epic-Level Status**
   - Read linked stories
   - Calculate completion percentage
   - If any In Progress → Epic In Progress
   - **"Done" rules:**
     - If epic has stories AND all stories Done → suggest "Done" (user confirms)
     - If epic has NO stories → cannot auto-mark "Done"
     - Prompt: "All stories complete. Mark epic as Done? [y/N]"

     > **Principle:** `reference-decisions.md` → Status Transition Rules

4. **Analyse Implementation**
   Use Task tool with Explore agent:

   ```text
   For epic [Title], check implementation:
   1. Code implementing acceptance criteria
   2. Test coverage for epic features
   3. Related documentation
   Assess: What percentage complete?
   ```

5. **Persona Consultation** (default when personas exist)

   If `sdlc-studio/personas/` contains persona files and `--skip-personas` was NOT passed:
   1. Read the epic's "Affected Personas" section
   2. For each listed persona, load their persona file
   3. Evaluate the review findings from their perspective:
      - Does the implementation meet their stated needs?
      - Are their frustrations addressed?
      - Are their "push back" triggers present?
   4. Include persona verdicts in the review output

   This step is **default when personas exist**. Use `--skip-personas` to opt out.

6. **Apply Mechanical Fixes and Update Files**

   Auto-apply these mechanical corrections (skip with `--no-fix`):
   1. Update dependency table statuses in THIS epic to match actual dependency statuses
   2. Tick AC checkboxes for criteria verified against the codebase
   3. Tick story breakdown checkboxes matching story file statuses
   4. Update epic `_index.md` entry if epic file status differs from index
   5. Recalculate epic `_index.md` summary counts

   Then:
   - Update epic Status field (if user confirmed a transition)
   - Update `**Last Updated:**` date if any changes were made
   - Add revision history entry summarising review changes
   - Store epic findings in `sdlc-studio/reviews/RV{NNNN}-{epic-id}-review.md`

7. **Report**

   ```text
   ## Epic Review: EP0001 - User Authentication

   ### Cascade Summary
   | Type | Reviewed | Skipped | Findings |
   |------|----------|---------|----------|
   | Story specs | 3 | 2 (unchanged) | 5 |
   | Story code | 2 | 3 (unchanged) | 3 |
   | Epic | 1 | 0 | 2 |

   ### Findings by Severity
   | Severity | Count |
   |----------|-------|
   | Critical | 0 |
   | Important | 4 |
   | Suggestions | 6 |

   ### Stories Reviewed
   - US0001: 2 important issues
   - US0003: 1 important issue, 2 suggestions
   - US0005: 1 suggestion

   ### Stories Skipped (unchanged since last review)
   - US0002: Reviewed 2026-01-25
   - US0004: Reviewed 2026-01-26

   ### Next Steps
   - [ ] Address important issues in US0001
   - [ ] Consider suggestions for US0003
   ```

### Quick Mode (--quick) {#quick-mode}

Skips story cascade, reviews only epic-level concerns:

1. **Load Epic**
   - Read from sdlc-studio/epics/
   - Parse acceptance criteria

2. **Check Story Status**
   - Read linked stories
   - Calculate completion only (no deep review)

3. **Update Epic**
   - Update Status field
   - Update _index.md

4. **Report**
   - Epic status
   - Story completion summary
   - No detailed findings

### Resume Mode (--resume) {#resume-mode}

Continues from last pause point using `.local/review-queue.json`:

1. **Load Queue State**
   - Read `.local/review-queue.json`
   - Find `current_index`
   - Verify queue is still valid (no new changes)

2. **Continue Execution**
   - Resume from paused item
   - Complete remaining queue items

3. **Cleanup**
   - Remove `.local/review-queue.json` on completion
   - Update `.local/review-state.json`

### Review Queue Persistence {#review-queue}

**File:** `sdlc-studio/.local/review-queue.json`

Enables pause/resume if review is interrupted:

```json
{
  "id": "RQ0001",
  "epic": "EP0001",
  "created": "2026-01-27T10:00:00Z",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "queue": [
    { "type": "story_spec", "id": "US0001", "status": "done" },
    { "type": "story_code", "id": "US0001", "status": "in_progress" },
    { "type": "story_spec", "id": "US0002", "status": "pending" }
  ],
  "current_index": 1
}
```

### Review State Tracking {#review-state-tracking}

**File:** `sdlc-studio/.local/review-state.json`

Tracks when each artifact was last reviewed. See `reference-outputs.md#review-state` for schema details.

**Modified-since detection:**

```text
needs_re_review(artifact):
  1. Load entry from review-state.json
  2. If no entry OR no last_reviewed: return TRUE
  3. Get last_modified via git log or file mtime
  4. If last_modified > last_reviewed: return TRUE
  5. return FALSE

code_changed_since_review(story):
  1. Get code_files list from story entry
  2. For each file: check git log timestamp
  3. If any file_modified > story.last_reviewed: return TRUE
  4. return FALSE
```

## Workflow Commands

Automated workflows for implementing all stories in an epic.

## /sdlc-studio epic plan - Step by Step {#epic-plan-workflow}

1. **Load Epic**
   - Read epic file from sdlc-studio/epics/
   - Verify epic exists and has stories

2. **List Stories**
   - Read all stories linked to epic
   - Filter to stories needing implementation:
     - Status: Ready (include)
     - Status: Done (exclude)
     - Status: Draft (warn - not ready)

3. **Analyse Dependencies**
   - Build dependency graph from story Dependencies sections
   - Detect cross-story dependencies:
     - Schema dependencies
     - API dependencies
     - Service dependencies
   - Check for circular dependencies (abort if found)

4. **Determine Execution Order**
   Use topological sort:

   ```text
   1. Find stories with no dependencies
   2. Process those first
   3. Unlock dependent stories as each completes
   4. Repeat until all stories processed
   ```

4b. **Analyse Agentic Groups (if `--agentic`)**

   Identify stories that can safely run concurrently by checking for shared file modifications.

   **Step 1: Classify each story's layer**

| | Layer | Indicators |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | Backend | API endpoints, services, models, migrations |
| | Frontend-component | Reusable components, utilities, theme constants |
| | Frontend-page | Page components that add routes |
| | Infra | Docker, CI/CD, config files |

   **Step 2: Identify hub files each story will modify**

   Hub files are shared files that multiple stories commonly modify:

| | Hub File | Layer | Typically Modified By |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | `App.tsx` (or router config) | Frontend | Every page story |
| | `types/index.ts` (or shared types) | Frontend | Every API-consuming story |
| | `api/client.ts` (or API layer) | Frontend | Every story calling new endpoints |
| | `main.py` (or app entry) | Backend | Every story adding a new router |
| | Primary router file (e.g., `routes/projects.py`) | Backend | Stories adding endpoints to same resource |
| | Index files (`_index.md`) | Docs | Every story at completion |

   For each story, list which hub files it will modify (based on story scope and technical notes).

   **Step 3: Assign parallel waves**

   Two stories may share a wave ONLY if they modify **zero hub files in common**. Apply these rules:

| | Rule | Safe? | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Backend + Frontend-component (no shared deps) | Yes | Different directories, no shared files |
| | Backend + Frontend-page | Caution | Page may need types/client from this backend story |
| | Two Frontend-pages | No | Both modify App.tsx, types, client |
| | Two Backend endpoints on same router | No | Both modify router file and main.py |
| | Two Backend endpoints on different routers | Caution | Both modify main.py |
| | Frontend-component + Frontend-page | Caution | Page may import from the component |

   **Step 4: Emit warnings**

   If `--agentic` is used but all stories are in the same layer, warn:

   ```text
   ⚠ Agentic mode: All stories are frontend-page - no safe concurrent groups found.
     Falling back to sequential execution.
   ```

   If a wave contains stories with possible (but unconfirmed) conflicts, warn:

   ```text
   ⚠ Wave 1: US0017 ‖ US0020 - cross-layer, likely safe.
     Verify neither story imports from the other before proceeding.
   ```

1. **Determine Approach Per Story**
   For each story, apply TDD decision tree:
   - API story with >5 edge cases → TDD
   - UI-heavy story → Test-After
   - Clear AC with complex rules → TDD
   - Exploratory implementation → Test-After

2. **Generate Preview**
   Output epic workflow plan:

   ```text
   ## Epic Workflow Plan: EP0004

   **Epic:** Agent Execution Engine
   **Stories:** 8 total (3 Done, 5 Ready)

   ### Execution Order

   | Order | Story | Title | Dependencies | Approach |
   |-------|-------|-------|--------------|----------|
   | 1 | US0023 | Config Schema | None | TDD |
   | 2 | US0024 | Action Queue API | US0023 | TDD |
   | 3 | US0025 | Script Parser | US0023 | TDD |
   | 4 | US0026 | Action Executor | US0024, US0025 | TDD |
   | 5 | US0027 | Agent Runner | US0026 | Test-After |

   ### Summary
   - **Stories to implement:** 5
   - **TDD stories:** 4
   - **Test-After stories:** 1
   - **Estimated phases:** 40 (8 per story)

   ### Dependency Graph
   US0023 --+-- US0024 --+-- US0026 -- US0027
            +-- US0025 --+

   Ready to execute? Run: /sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004
   ```

   **With `--agentic` flag**, also include the agentic wave analysis:

   ```text
   ### Agentic Waves

   | Wave | Stories | Layer(s) | Shared Hub Files | Safe? |
   |------|---------|----------|------------------|-------|
   | 1 | US0017 ‖ US0020 | Backend ‖ Frontend-component | None | ✅ Yes |
   | 2 | US0018 | Frontend-page | App.tsx, types, client | - |
   | 3 | US0019 | Frontend-page | App.tsx | - |

   **Sequential waves:** 3 (vs 4 sequential)
   **Parallel stories:** Wave 1 (2 stories concurrently)

   ⚠ US0018 and US0019 cannot be parallelised: both modify App.tsx

   Ready to execute? Run: /sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --agentic
   ```

---

## /sdlc-studio epic implement - Step by Step {#epic-implement-workflow}

1. **Load or Create Epic Workflow State**
   - Check for existing workflow in sdlc-studio/workflows/
   - If exists, load state and determine resume point
   - If not exists, create from `templates/epic-workflow-template.md`
   - Assign next workflow ID: WF{NNNN}

2. **Validate Prerequisites**
   - Epic exists
   - Has stories in Ready status
   - No circular dependencies
   - If `--story` flag, validate that story is in epic
   - If `--agentic` flag, validate agentic wave analysis was done (run `epic plan --agentic` first if not)
   - If `--agentic` flag, verify clean git state:
     1. Run `git status --short` -- if modified/untracked source files exist, **STOP**
     2. Prompt: "Uncommitted changes detected. Agentic waves use git worktrees that branch from HEAD -- uncommitted work will not be visible to agents. Commit or stash before proceeding."
     3. Only proceed when `git status` shows no modified source files (sdlc-studio/ changes are acceptable)

3. **Determine Starting Point**
   - If `--story US000X`: start from that story
   - Otherwise: start from first story (or first wave) in execution order

4. **Process Stories**

   **Sequential mode (default):**

   For each story in execution order:

   a. **Check Dependencies**
      - All dependent stories must be Done
      - If not Done, mark story as Blocked and skip

   b. **Execute Story Workflow**

      ```text
      /sdlc-studio story implement --story US000X
      ```

   c. **Handle Result**
      - On success: Update story → Done, continue to next
      - On failure: Pause epic workflow, report error

   **Agentic mode (`--agentic`):**

   For each wave in the agentic plan:

   a. **Check Wave Prerequisites**
      - All prior waves must be complete
      - All dependency stories for this wave must be Done

   b. **Pre-flight Shared File Check**
      Before launching parallel stories, verify no hub file conflicts:
      - List files each story will modify (from plan analysis)
      - If any file appears in more than one story in this wave: **ABORT wave, fall back to sequential**
      - Report the conflict and which stories caused it

   c. **Execute Stories in Parallel**
      Launch concurrent story workflows using the Agent tool with worktree isolation.
      Each agent receives a **full implementation prompt** (not a slash command).

      **Critical:** If a story modifies a hub file (e.g. `src/api/app.ts`), do NOT include that hub file in the agent's file scope. Instead, instruct the agent to create a sidecar file (e.g. `src/api/routes/new-route.ts`) and integrate the hub file manually during post-wave merge.

      See [Agent Prompt Template](#agent-prompt-template) below for the full prompt structure.

      ```text
      # Example: launch two agents in parallel (single message, two Agent tool calls)
      Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", isolation="worktree", prompt="Implement US0017...")
      Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", isolation="worktree", prompt="Implement US0020...")
      ```

   d. **Wait for All Stories in Wave**
      - Both must complete before advancing to next wave
      - If either fails: pause epic at that wave, report which story failed

   e. **Post-Wave Merge Protocol**
      After all agents in a wave complete, merge their work into the main working directory. Follow this checklist in order:

      **Step 1: Inventory changes per worktree**

      ```bash
      # For each worktree agent:
      git -C .claude/worktrees/agent-{id} status --short
      ```

      Classify each file as: NEW (untracked) or MODIFIED (changed from HEAD).

      **Step 2: Copy new files (no conflicts possible)**

      ```bash
      cp worktree/src/lib/new-module.ts main/src/lib/new-module.ts
      cp worktree/src/lib/new-module.test.ts main/src/lib/new-module.test.ts
      ```

      New files from different agents cannot conflict (wave analysis confirmed no shared files). Copy them directly. Create directories as needed with `mkdir -p`.

      **Step 3: Copy single-agent modified files**
      If only ONE agent modified a file, copy it directly:

      ```bash
      cp worktree/src/lib/bridge/client.ts main/src/lib/bridge/client.ts
      ```

      **Step 4: Manually merge hub files (if multiple agents touched them)**
      If two agents both modified the same file (e.g. both added sections to a page):
      1. Read the main version (current state before this wave)
      2. Read each agent's version (see what they added)
      3. Apply each agent's additions to the main version using Edit
      4. Typical merges: new imports, new component sections, new route registrations

      **Step 5: Verify**

      ```bash
      pnpm typecheck    # Zero errors required
      pnpm test         # All tests must pass
      ```

      **Step 6: Diagnose failures (if any)**
| | Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | `Cannot find module` | Agent created file in worktree not yet copied | Copy the missing file |
| | `Type X is not assignable` | Agent used a different interface shape | Align to canonical type |
| | `Duplicate identifier` | Both agents defined the same type | Delete agent's copy, import from canonical |
| | `Property X does not exist` | Agent added a field to an interface, other code doesn't know | Update the interface in the canonical location |
| | `Test X failed` | Merge introduced incompatibility | Read the test, understand what changed, fix |

      **Step 7: Reconcile wave stories**

      ```bash
      /sdlc-studio reconcile --scope stories
      ```

      **Step 8: Clean up worktrees**
      Worktrees are cleaned up automatically if the agent made no changes. For worktrees with changes (already merged), remove manually if disk space is a concern:

      ```bash
      git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/agent-{id}
      git branch -d worktree-agent-{id}
      ```

      Worktrees from completed waves are safe to remove once merged and verified.

   f. **Advance to Next Wave**
      - Continue to next wave only when all stories in current wave are Done
      - Repeat until all waves complete

5. **Handle Story Errors**
   When a story workflow fails:
   - Update epic workflow status to Paused
   - Record which story and phase failed
   - Report error and resume instructions:

     ```text
     ## Epic Workflow Paused

     **Epic:** EP0004 - Agent Execution Engine
     **Paused At:** US0024 - Action Queue API
     **Story Phase:** 5. Verify (tests failed)

     ### Story Progress
     | Story | Status | Notes |
     |-------|--------|-------|
     | US0023 | Done | Completed |
     | US0024 | Paused | Tests failed |
     | US0025 | Pending | |
     | US0026 | Blocked | Waiting for US0024 |
     | US0027 | Blocked | Waiting for US0026 |

     ### To Resume
     1. Fix the issue in US0024
     2. Run: /sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --story US0024
     ```

6. **Complete Epic Workflow**
   When all stories complete:
   - Update epic workflow status to Done
   - Update epic status to Done (user confirms)
   - **Run the Epic Completion Cascade** (canonical checklist: `reference-outputs.md` → [Epic Completion Cascade](reference-outputs.md#epic-completion-cascade))
   - Report completion:

     ```text
     ## Epic Workflow Complete

     **Epic:** EP0004 - Agent Execution Engine
     **Duration:** 3 hours 45 minutes
     **Stories:** 5 completed

     ### Summary
     | Story | Status | Duration | Approach |
     |-------|--------|----------|----------|
     | US0023 | Done | 35m | TDD |
     | US0024 | Done | 52m | TDD |
     | US0025 | Done | 41m | TDD |
     | US0026 | Done | 58m | TDD |
     | US0027 | Done | 39m | Test-After |

     Run `/sdlc-studio epic review` to update epic status.
     ```

### Post-Epic Completion Cascade {#post-epic-checklist}

When all stories in an epic reach terminal status and the user confirms Done, execute the **Epic Completion Cascade** immediately.

**Canonical checklist:** `reference-outputs.md` → [Epic Completion Cascade](reference-outputs.md#epic-completion-cascade)

Follow all 9 steps: update epic file (status + Last Updated + AC checkboxes + story breakdown), update epic index, update PRD feature statuses, update dependency tables in ALL other epics, recalculate story index, update PRD metadata, consult affected personas, flag TRD/TSD for review, run reconcile catch-up.

**Note:** During `epic implement`, story statuses are auto-set to Done as each story completes. This is acceptable because the user approved the batch workflow at the epic level.

## Workflow Flags {#workflow-flags}

### --story US000X {#flag-story}

Start from specific story (useful for resume):

```bash
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --story US0024
```

### --skip US000X {#flag-skip}

Skip a problematic story and continue:

```bash
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --skip US0025
```

### --agentic {#flag-agentic}

> **Before any agentic execution:** Load `reference-agentic-lessons.md`. It contains battle-tested lessons from production runs that significantly affect quality and speed.

Enable autonomous concurrent execution for stories that share no hub files.

```bash
# Plan with agentic wave analysis
/sdlc-studio epic plan --epic EP0004 --agentic

# Execute with agentic waves
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --agentic
```

**When to use:** Epics with a clear backend/frontend split where independent stories exist.

**When NOT to use:**

- All stories are in the same layer (all frontend pages, all backend endpoints)
- Stories have tight data dependencies (one creates types the other consumes)
- Epic has fewer than 4 stories (overhead exceeds benefit)

**Safety guarantees:**

- Stories in the same wave must modify zero files in common
- Full test suite runs after each wave completes
- Falls back to sequential if hub file conflict detected at runtime
- `--agentic` on `epic plan` shows the analysis; `--agentic` on `epic implement` executes it

**Agentic mode has two artifact modes:**

| Mode | Flag | Plan/TestSpec/Workflow files | Status transitions | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Default agentic** | `--agentic` | Created per story (lightweight) | Full (Planned -> In Progress -> Done) | Audit trail needed, debugging expected |
| **No-artifacts agentic** | `--agentic --no-artifacts` | Not created | Compressed (Ready -> Done) | Full project batch, greenfield, maximum speed |

### Default Agentic (with artifacts) {#agentic-with-artifacts}

When `--agentic` is used **without** `--no-artifacts`, agents still create per-story artifacts:

1. **Plan file (PL)** created before agent launches - contains: file scope, AC summary, approach (TDD/test-after), edge case table. Lightweight but written to disk.
2. **Test spec file (TS)** created alongside plan - contains: AC-to-test mapping, fixture stubs.
3. **Workflow file (WF)** created at start - tracks phase progress for resumability.
4. Story status transitions through all states: Ready -> Planned -> In Progress -> Done.
5. Story completion cascade runs after each story (updates indexes, dependency tables, epic checkboxes).
6. **Reconcile runs after each wave** - fixes any drift in indexes and dependency tables.

This is the **recommended mode** for most development. Artifacts provide:

- Resumability if a session is interrupted
- Audit trail for debugging failed stories
- Traceability from AC to plan to test to code

### --no-artifacts {#flag-no-artifacts}

Suppress creation of per-story plan, test-spec, and workflow files. For maximum throughput at batch scale.

```bash
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --agentic --no-artifacts
```

**What is suppressed:**

- Plan files (`sdlc-studio/plans/PL{NNNN}-*.md`) - agent prompt IS the plan
- Test spec files (`sdlc-studio/test-specs/TS{NNNN}-*.md`) - story AC IS the spec
- Workflow files (`sdlc-studio/workflows/WF{NNNN}-*.md`) - epic/project state tracks progress
- Intermediate status transitions (Planned, In Progress, Review) - stories go Ready -> Done

**What is still enforced:**

- Typecheck must pass after each wave
- Full test suite must pass after each wave
- AC verification against code (phase 6)
- Linter/quality checks (phase 7)
- Story completion cascade (status updates, index entries, dependency tables)
- **Reconcile after each wave** (scoped to stories in the wave)

**When to use `--no-artifacts`:**

- Full project implementation via `project implement`
- Greenfield projects where all stories are new
- When PRD/TRD/TSD provide sufficient context (no per-story planning needed)

**When NOT to use:**

- Debugging a specific story failure (need the plan to understand what went wrong)
- Compliance projects requiring formal audit artifacts
- Resuming interrupted work (no WF file means no auto-resume)

See `reference-project.md#mode-guide` for the full decision tree.

### Quality Gates at Wave Boundaries {#wave-quality-gates}

After each wave completes (all parallel agents return), these gates are **enforced** (blocking):

1. **Typecheck** - detect: `tsconfig.json` -> `npx tsc --noEmit`; `go.mod` -> `go vet ./...`
2. **Test suite** - detect: `package.json` -> `pnpm test` or `npm test`; `pyproject.toml` -> `pytest`
3. **Reconcile** - `reconcile --scope stories` to fix drift from the wave's story completions
4. All three must pass. On failure: pause execution, report failures, print resume instructions.

These gates are mandatory and cannot be skipped. They replace the per-story verify/check/review phases with wave-boundary enforcement and prevent drift from accumulating across waves.

## Agent Prompt Template {#agent-prompt-template}

The quality of agentic implementation depends almost entirely on the prompt each worktree agent receives. A well-structured prompt replaces the plan file, test spec, and scope boundaries. A vague prompt produces inconsistent, low-quality code.

### Prompt Structure

Every agentic implementation prompt MUST contain these sections in this order:

```markdown
## Task: Implement US{NNNN} - {Story Title}

{Framework} project. {One sentence of context about what this story does.}

### What to Build
{2-3 sentences describing the deliverable. Not the full AC - a human summary.}

### READ THESE FILES FIRST
{Numbered list of existing files the agent must read before writing anything.
Include what to look for in each file. This is the most important section -
it establishes the patterns the agent must follow.
**Populate this list from the repo map, not from memory.** Run
`scripts/repo_map.py query --story <story-path> --top 10` first and
use the output as the starting file set. Prune obvious false positives
and add any files the indexer missed (hub files, shared types, schema
definitions). If the repo map is absent or older than an hour, rebuild
first with `repo_map.py build`. See `reference-repo-map.md` for details.}

1. `src/lib/bridge/client.ts` - BridgeClient class, Zod schema pattern, error handling
2. `src/db/bridges.ts` - CRUD helper pattern (insertBridge, getBridge, etc.)
3. `src/app/bridges/page.tsx` - Server Component page pattern
4. `src/components/ui/badge.tsx` - shadcn Badge component
5. `vitest.config.ts` - Test configuration

### Acceptance Criteria
{Verbatim Given/When/Then from story file. Do not paraphrase.}

### Files to Create
{Explicit paths for new files this agent should create.}
- `src/lib/backup/engine.ts`
- `src/lib/backup/engine.test.ts`

### Files to Modify
{Explicit paths for existing files this agent should change.}
- `src/lib/bridge/client.ts` - Add getMetrics() method
- `src/db/schema.ts` - Add snapshots table

### DO NOT Modify
{Hub files or files being modified by other agents in this wave.}
- `src/app/page.tsx` (being modified by another agent)
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (hub file - integrate manually after)

### Codebase Patterns to Follow
{Key conventions extracted from READ THESE FILES FIRST.
Be specific - naming, imports, error handling, styling.}

- Server Components: `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`, data via direct DB call
- Client Components: `'use client'`, useState for state, useRouter().refresh() after mutations
- Styling: Tailwind with `cn()` utility, `bg-card rounded-lg border border-border p-6`
- Errors: Custom error classes with `code` property, never throw raw strings
- IDs: `crypto.randomUUID()`, timestamps as ISO 8601 strings
- Imports: `@/` alias for `src/`

### Implementation Steps
{Ordered steps. Include code snippets for Zod schemas, interfaces, or
complex logic where the shape matters. Skip snippets for straightforward
CRUD or UI rendering.}

1. Add Zod schema to client.ts: `export const SnapshotSchema = z.object({ ... })`
2. Create engine.ts with backup flow: quiesce -> tar -> store -> resume
3. Write tests covering: success, storage failure, agent resume on failure

### Testing

{What to test. Minimum counts. Framework specifics.}

Write tests in `src/lib/backup/engine.test.ts`:

- Successful backup creates snapshot and stores archive
- Failed storage marks snapshot as failed
- Agent always resumed even on failure
- Audit entry logged

Use `vi.stubGlobal('fetch', fetchMock)` for HTTP mocks.
Use in-memory SQLite for DB tests.

### Quality Gates

{Non-negotiable requirements.}

1. `pnpm typecheck` - zero errors
2. `pnpm test` - all tests pass (existing + new)
3. No `any` types - use `unknown` with type guards
4. British English in comments and user-facing strings

### What Makes a Good Prompt

| Aspect | Bad | Good |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | "Implement the backup feature" | "Create `src/lib/backup/engine.ts` with quiesce/tar/store/resume flow" |
| Patterns | "Follow existing patterns" | "Use `cn()` from `src/lib/utils.ts`, `bg-card` class for cards" |
| Files | "Create necessary files" | Explicit list of files to create AND modify |
| AC | Paraphrased | Verbatim Given/When/Then from story |
| Exclusions | None | "DO NOT modify src/app/page.tsx" |
| Tests | "Write tests" | "8 tests covering: success, failure, edge case X, edge case Y" |
| Context | None | "READ THESE FILES FIRST: 1. client.ts for Zod pattern..." |

### Building the Prompt

Before writing the prompt, the orchestrator MUST:

1. **Explore the codebase** (or use an Explore agent) to understand:
   - File structure and naming conventions
   - Existing patterns for the type of code being written
   - Canonical type locations (where shared interfaces live)
   - Test patterns (mocking approach, assertion style)
   - Hub files that multiple stories touch

2. **Read key files** to extract concrete patterns (not guesses):
   - The main layout/entry point
   - An existing page similar to what the story creates
   - An existing test file for the testing pattern
   - The database schema
   - The relevant client/service module

3. **Map story AC to file changes** to determine:
   - Which files need creating (agent's exclusive scope)
   - Which files need modifying (check for hub file conflicts)
   - Which files should NOT be touched (other agents' scope)

This exploration typically happens ONCE per epic (before wave 1) and the findings are reused across all waves in that epic. The key files, patterns, and conventions don't change within an epic.

### Inter-Epic Context

When implementing later epics that depend on earlier ones (e.g. EP0004 depends on EP0001):
- Earlier epic code is already committed to git HEAD
- Agent prompts should reference files from earlier epics in "READ THESE FILES FIRST"
- Example: EP0004 agents should read `src/lib/bridge/client.ts` (from EP0001) to understand BridgeClient patterns
- The commit strategy (per-epic) ensures earlier code is available to later agents

## Epic Workflow Error Handling {#epic-workflow-error-handling}

### Error Types {#error-types}

| Error | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Story workflow fails | Pause epic at failing story |
| Circular dependency detected | Abort with dependency graph |
| All remaining stories blocked | Pause with blocker info |
| Story not in Ready status | Skip with warning |
| Hub file conflict in agentic wave | Abort wave, fall back to sequential for conflicting stories |
| Agentic story overwrites shared file | Detected in post-wave verification; re-run affected story sequentially |

### Recovery Strategies {#recovery-strategies}

**Option 1: Fix and Resume**
```bash
# Fix the issue in the failed story
# Then resume from that story
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --story US0024
```

**Option 2: Skip and Continue**

```bash
# Skip problematic story, continue with others
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --skip US0024
```

**Option 3: Manual Story Completion**

```bash
# Complete story manually
/sdlc-studio story implement --story US0024 --from-phase 5
# Then resume epic
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --story US0025
```
