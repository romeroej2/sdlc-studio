# SDLC Studio

Manage project specifications and test artifacts. Supports the full pipeline from PRD creation through Epic decomposition, User Story generation, and streamlined test automation.

This file is the always-loaded router. It carries only what is needed to route a request:
philosophy gates, the Progressive Loading Guide, and pointers. The full command catalogue,
argument reference, workflow diagrams, and reference index are loaded on demand from
`help/help.md`, `help/arguments.md`, and `help/references.md`.

## Critical Philosophy (Read This First)

**Two modes for every artifact type:**

| Mode | Purpose | When to Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **create** | Author new specifications from user input | Greenfield projects, new features |
| **generate** | Extract specifications from existing code | Brownfield projects, documentation gaps |

> **New to Create vs Generate?** Read `reference-philosophy.md` - it explains why these modes exist and how they differ fundamentally.
>
> **Using generate mode?** You MUST read `reference-philosophy.md#generate-mode` first - generated specs must be validated by tests.

**Generate mode is NOT documentation.** It produces a **migration blueprint** - a specification detailed enough that another team could rebuild the system in a different technology stack. Generated specs MUST be validated by running tests against the existing implementation.

> **Operating Doctrine – onboarding to a project? Read `reference-doctrine.md` first.** It is the project-*agnostic* working discipline (the skill is the operating system; RFC/CR/ADR choice; files-are-truth + reconcile-from-census; reconcile/verify/review cadence; ship-paperwork-in-the-same-commit; consult gates; TDD; cross-repo numbering; **recall cross-project `lessons/` before substantive decisions**). A project's own `CLAUDE.md` = this doctrine + that project's specifics. The cross-project lessons-learned folder is `lessons/` (see `help/lessons.md`).

## Quick Start

```bash
/sdlc-studio help                    # Full command reference (help/help.md)
/sdlc-studio status                  # Check pipeline state and next steps
/sdlc-studio hint                    # Single actionable next step
/sdlc-studio review                  # Unified PRD/TRD/TSD/Persona review
/sdlc-studio reconcile               # Fix all status drift in one pass
/sdlc-studio prd generate            # Create PRD from codebase
/sdlc-studio epic                    # Generate Epics from PRD
/sdlc-studio story                   # Generate Stories from Epics
/sdlc-studio code plan               # Plan implementation for story
/sdlc-studio code implement          # Execute implementation plan
/sdlc-studio story implement         # Execute story workflow (all phases)
/sdlc-studio epic implement          # Execute epic workflow (all stories)
/sdlc-studio project implement       # Execute all epics in dependency order
```

For the full catalogue (bug, cr, rfc, persona, consult, chat, trd, test-*, repo map,
sync, and every flag), run `/sdlc-studio help` or read `help/help.md`.

## Get Help for Any Type

```bash
/sdlc-studio {type} help             # Type-specific commands, prerequisites, output, examples
```

Examples: `/sdlc-studio epic help`, `/sdlc-studio code help`, `/sdlc-studio bug help`.

## When to Use

Use when asked about: PRD, TRD, epics, stories, personas, bugs, code planning, implementation, testing, test specs, test automation, project status, or any `/sdlc-studio` command.

## Instructions

When invoked with `/sdlc-studio [type] [action]`:

1. **Parse Command:** Extract type and action from arguments
2. **Load Help File:** Read `help/{type}.md` for command-specific guidance
3. **Check Philosophy:** If generate mode, load `reference-philosophy.md#generate-mode` FIRST
4. **Follow Progressive Loading:**
   - Load reference files only for multi-step workflows
   - Load templates only when creating artifacts
   - Load decision files when choosing approaches (TDD, Ready status)
5. **Execute Workflow:** Follow step-by-step procedure in reference file
6. **Update Status:** Modify artifact status markers per `reference-outputs.md`
7. **Validate:** Check Ready criteria in `reference-decisions.md` before proceeding

**Note:** Version checks run on `hint` and `status` commands only (see those help files).

See "Progressive Loading Guide" below for detailed file loading patterns.

**Template structure:**

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `templates/core/*.md` | Streamlined core templates (v2) |
| `templates/indexes/*.md` | Index file templates |
| `templates/modules/trd/*.md` | Optional TRD modules (diagrams, containers, ADR) |
| `templates/modules/tsd/*.md` | Optional TSD modules (contract, perf, security) |
| `templates/modules/epic/*.md` | Optional Epic perspective modules |
| `templates/config-defaults.yaml` | Skill default configuration |

**Module loading flags:**

| Flag | Modules Loaded |
| --- | --- |
| `trd create --with-diagrams` | modules/trd/c4-diagrams.md |
| `trd create --with-containers` | modules/trd/container-design.md |
| `trd create --full` | All TRD modules |
| `epic --perspective engineering` | modules/epic/engineering-view.md |
| `epic --perspective product` | modules/epic/product-view.md |
| `epic --perspective test` | modules/epic/test-view.md |

**Reference file mapping:**

Reference files follow the pattern `reference-{domain}.md`. When executing
a workflow, load the reference file matching the artifact type being created
or modified. Cross-domain files (`reference-decisions.md`, `reference-outputs.md`,
`reference-philosophy.md`) load as needed for validation, status updates, and
approach decisions. The full index is in `help/references.md`.

## Type Reference

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `prd` | Product Requirements Document |
| `trd` | Technical Requirements Document |
| `tsd` | Test Strategy Document (project-level) |
| `persona` | User Personas |
| `consult` | Persona consultation on artefacts |
| `chat` | Interactive persona sessions |
| `epic` | Feature groupings (Epics) |
| `story` | User Stories with acceptance criteria |
| `code` | Implementation planning, testing, and quality |
| `test-spec` | Consolidated test specification (plan + cases + fixtures) |
| `test-automation` | Generate executable test code |
| `test-env` | Containerised test environment setup |
| `bug` | Bug tracking and traceability |
| `cr` | Change requests (post-PRD change proposals) |
| `rfc` | Request For Comments – design exploration of an unsettled space, pre-CR |
| `project` | Project-level orchestration across all epics |
| `reconcile` | Detect and fix status drift across all artifacts |
| `status` | Visual dashboard: Requirements, Code, Tests health |
| `hint` | Single actionable next step |
| `help` | Show command reference and examples |

## Full Reference

The catalogues that used to live inline are now loaded on demand to keep this router lean:

| You need... | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Every command, grouped by pipeline, with examples | `help/help.md` (or run `/sdlc-studio help`) |
| The complete argument and flag table | `help/arguments.md` |
| Workflow diagrams (greenfield, brownfield, agentic, project) | `help/help.md` "Typical Workflows" |
| The full `reference-*.md` index and template structure | `help/references.md` |
| Type-specific commands, prerequisites, output, examples | `help/{type}.md` |
| Step-by-step workflow detail for an artifact | `reference-{domain}.md` |

## Error Handling

**Missing prerequisites:** Prompts to run earlier pipeline step (e.g., no PRD → `prd`, no epics → `epic`, no stories → `story`, no plans → `code plan`). **Existing files:** Warns and asks to continue unless `--force`. **No type:** Asks user which type. **ID collision:** Auto-increments. **Open questions:** Reports and pauses. **Unknown language:** Asks user to specify framework.
