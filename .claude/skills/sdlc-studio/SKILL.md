# SDLC Studio

Manage project specifications and test artifacts. Supports the full pipeline from PRD creation through Epic decomposition, User Story generation, and streamlined test automation.

## Critical Philosophy (Read This First)

**Two modes for every artifact type:**

| Mode | Purpose | When to Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **create** | Author new specifications from user input | Greenfield projects, new features |
| **generate** | Extract specifications from existing code | Brownfield projects, documentation gaps |

> **New to Create vs Generate?** Read `reference-philosophy.md` - it explains why these modes exist and how they differ fundamentally.
>
> **Using generate mode?** You MUST read `reference-philosophy.md#generate-mode` first - generated specs must be validated by tests.

**Generate mode is NOT documentation.** It produces a **migration blueprint** - a specification detailed enough that another team could rebuild the system in a different technology stack. Generated specs MUST be validated by running tests against the existing implementation.

## Quick Start

```bash
/sdlc-studio help                    # Show command reference
/sdlc-studio status                  # Check pipeline state and next steps
/sdlc-studio review                  # Unified PRD/TRD/TSD review
/sdlc-studio reconcile               # Fix all status drift in one pass
/sdlc-studio upgrade --dry-run       # Preview schema upgrade
/sdlc-studio prd generate            # Create PRD from codebase
/sdlc-studio trd generate            # Create TRD from codebase
/sdlc-studio epic                    # Generate Epics from PRD
/sdlc-studio story                   # Generate Stories from Epics
/sdlc-studio bug                     # Create or list bugs

/sdlc-studio story plan              # Create plan + test-spec, then review
/sdlc-studio story implement         # Execute story workflow (all phases)
/sdlc-studio epic plan               # Preview epic workflow (all stories)
/sdlc-studio epic implement          # Execute epic workflow (all stories)
/sdlc-studio project plan            # Preview project execution plan
/sdlc-studio project implement       # Execute all epics in dependency order
```

## Get Help for Any Type

```bash
/sdlc-studio {type} help             # Show help for specific type
```

Examples:

```bash
/sdlc-studio prd help                # PRD commands and options
/sdlc-studio epic help               # Epic generation help
/sdlc-studio bug help                # Bug tracking help
/sdlc-studio code help               # Code plan/test/verify/check help
/sdlc-studio test-spec help          # Test specification help
/sdlc-studio test-automation help    # Test automation help
```

Each help page shows:

- Available actions and what they do
- Prerequisites
- Output format and location
- Examples
- Next steps

## When to Use

Use when asked about: PRD, TRD, epics, stories, personas, bugs, code planning, implementation, testing, test specs, test automation, project status, or any `/sdlc-studio` command.

## Instructions

When invoked with `/sdlc-studio [type] [action]`:

1. **Parse Command:** Extract type and action from arguments
2. **Load Help File:** Read `help/{type}.md` for command-specific guidance
3. **Check Philosophy:** If generate mode, load `reference-philosophy.md#generate-mode` FIRST
4. **Follow Progressive Loading:**
   - Load reference files only for multi-step workflows
   - Load templates only when creating artifacts
   - Load decision files when choosing approaches (TDD, Ready status)
5. **Execute Workflow:** Follow step-by-step procedure in reference file
6. **Update Status:** Modify artifact status markers per `reference-outputs.md`
7. **Validate:** Check Ready criteria in `reference-decisions.md` before proceeding

**Note:** Version checks run on `hint` and `status` commands only (see those help files).

See "Progressive Loading Guide" below for detailed file loading patterns.

## Progressive Loading Guide

Claude loads files progressively based on task needs:

| Task Type | Primary Load | Secondary Load | Decision Load |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Understanding command | help/{type}.md | - | - |
| Create mode workflow | help/{type}.md | reference-{domain}.md | reference-philosophy.md#create-mode |
| Generate mode workflow | reference-philosophy.md#generate-mode | help/{type}.md | reference-{domain}.md |
| Creating artifacts | templates/core/{type}.md | reference-outputs.md | - |
| Loading modules | templates/modules/{domain}/*.md | - | - |
| Planning code | reference-code.md#code-plan-workflow | reference-decisions.md#story-ready | best-practices/{language}.md |
| Choosing TDD/Test-After | reference-decisions.md#tdd-decision-tree | reference-test-best-practices.md | - |
| Validating Ready status | reference-decisions.md#{type}-ready | reference-outputs.md | - |
| Document review | reference-review.md | reference-{doc}.md | - |
| Schema upgrade | reference-upgrade.md | reference-config.md | - |
| Project orchestration | reference-project.md | reference-epic.md | reference-config.md |
| Agentic execution | reference-agentic-lessons.md | reference-epic.md | - |
| Change request workflow | help/cr.md | reference-cr.md | reference-outputs.md |
| Invoking skill internals | reference-scripts.md | scripts/README.md | - |
| Ranking files for a story | reference-repo-map.md | help/repo-map.md | reference-epic.md#agent-prompt-template |
| Verifying ACs against codebase | reference-verify.md | help/verify.md | reference-reconcile.md#verify-scope |

**Template structure:**

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `templates/core/*.md` | Streamlined core templates (v2) |
| `templates/indexes/*.md` | Index file templates |
| `templates/modules/trd/*.md` | Optional TRD modules (diagrams, containers, ADR) |
| `templates/modules/tsd/*.md` | Optional TSD modules (contract, perf, security) |
| `templates/modules/epic/*.md` | Optional Epic perspective modules |
| `templates/config-defaults.yaml` | Skill default configuration |

**Module loading flags:**

| Flag | Modules Loaded |
| --- | --- |
| `trd create --with-diagrams` | modules/trd/c4-diagrams.md |
| `trd create --with-containers` | modules/trd/container-design.md |
| `trd create --full` | All TRD modules |
| `epic --perspective engineering` | modules/epic/engineering-view.md |
| `epic --perspective product` | modules/epic/product-view.md |
| `epic --perspective test` | modules/epic/test-view.md |

**Reference file mapping:**

Reference files follow the pattern `reference-{domain}.md`. When executing
a workflow, load the reference file matching the artifact type being created
or modified. Cross-domain files (`reference-decisions.md`, `reference-outputs.md`,
`reference-philosophy.md`) load as needed for validation, status updates, and
approach decisions.

### Utilities

Skill-internal helpers live at `.claude/skills/sdlc-studio/scripts/`. Claude invokes these on behalf of workflows; users do not call them directly. See `reference-scripts.md` for the full catalogue.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/sdlc-studio repo map build` | Index the repository symbols and imports |
| `/sdlc-studio repo map build --ignore vendor` | Skip an extra directory during indexing |
| `/sdlc-studio repo map query --story US0001` | Rank files by relevance to a story |
| `/sdlc-studio repo map query --story "auth flow"` | Rank files by a free-text query |
| `/sdlc-studio repo map stats` | Index size and top-10 hub files |

## Workflows

For detailed step-by-step workflows, see reference files:

- `reference-prd.md`, `reference-trd.md`, `reference-persona.md` - PRD, TRD, Persona workflows
- `reference-epic.md`, `reference-story.md`, `reference-bug.md` - Epic, Story, Bug workflows
- `reference-project.md` - Project-level orchestration across all epics
- `reference-code.md` - Code plan, implement, verify, check, test workflows
- `reference-refactor.md` - Code refactor, review workflows
- `reference-tsd.md` - TSD, status dashboard workflows
- `reference-test-spec.md` - Test specification workflows
- `reference-test-automation.md` - Test automation, test environment workflows

---

## Error Handling

**Missing prerequisites:** Prompts to run earlier pipeline step (e.g., no PRD → `prd`, no epics → `epic`, no stories → `story`, no plans → `code plan`). **Existing files:** Warns and asks to continue unless `--force`. **No type:** Asks user which type. **ID collision:** Auto-increments. **Open questions:** Reports and pauses. **Unknown language:** Asks user to specify framework.

## Typical Workflow

### Greenfield (Create Mode)

```text

PRD → TRD → Personas → Epics → Stories
                                  │
                    ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
                    │                           │
              TDD Path                    Test-After Path
              (test-first)                (code-first)
                    │                           │
              test-spec                    code plan
                    │                           │
              code plan                   code implement
                    │                           │
         code implement --tdd              test-spec
                    │                           │
              code verify                 test-automation
                    │                           │
              code test                     code verify
                                                │
                                            code test
```

**Per-story choice:** You choose TDD or Test-After for each story, not globally. Both paths produce the same artifacts, just in different order.

### Automated Workflow (Recommended)

For streamlined development, use workflow automation:

```text

PRD → TRD → Personas → Epics → Stories
                                  │
                          story plan --story US0001
                                  │
                          story implement --story US0001
                                  │
                          (all 7 phases run automatically)
```

Or at the epic level:

```text

PRD → TRD → Personas → Epics → Stories
                                  │
                          epic plan --epic EP0001
                                  │
                          epic implement --epic EP0001
                                  │
                          (all stories processed in dependency order)
```

Or with autonomous execution for maximum throughput:

```text

PRD → TRD → Personas → Epics → Stories
                                  │
                       epic plan --epic EP0001 --agentic
                                  │
                    (analyses dependencies → assigns concurrent waves)
                                  │
                       epic implement --epic EP0001 --agentic
                                  │
                    Wave 1: [US0001, US0003] concurrent
                    Wave 2: [US0002, US0004] concurrent
                    Wave 3: [US0005] sequential (hub file conflict)
```

`--agentic` analyses the dependency graph and hub file overlap to identify stories that can safely execute concurrently. Falls back to sequential for any stories with shared file conflicts.

**Workflow phases per story:**

1. Plan (code plan)
2. Test Spec (test-spec)
3. Tests (test-automation)
4. Implement (code implement)
5. Test (code test)
6. Verify (code verify)
7. Check (code check)
8. Review (status review)

### Project Implementation (Full PRD in One Pass)

For implementing an entire PRD across all epics with maximum throughput:

```text

PRD → TRD → Personas → Epics → Stories
                                  │
                    project plan --agentic
                                  │
                    project implement --agentic --no-artifacts
                                  │
                    EP0001: epic implement --agentic
                        → commit → reconcile
                    EP0002: epic implement --agentic
                        → commit → reconcile
                    EP0003: epic implement --agentic
                        → commit → reconcile → review (every 3 epics)
                    ...
                    Final: review → reconcile → report
```

**Quality gates enforced at every boundary:**

- Wave: typecheck + test suite
- Epic: reconcile + status cascade + commit
- Every 3 epics: quick review
- Project: full review + reconcile + code check

See `reference-project.md` for the full workflow.

### Brownfield (Specification Extraction)

```bash

prd generate → trd generate → persona generate → epic → story generate → test-spec → test-automation → code test (VALIDATE)
```

**Critical:** The `code test` step validates specs against reality. Not optional.

### Development Cycle

```text

code plan → code implement → code test → code verify → code check
```

Status: `Draft/Ready → Planned → In Progress → Review → Done`

### Daily Usage

```bash

/sdlc-studio status          # Visual dashboard - what needs attention?
/sdlc-studio status --brief  # Quick: Requirements 85% | Code 90% | Tests 94%
/sdlc-studio hint            # Single next step
/sdlc-studio code plan       # Plan next story
/sdlc-studio code implement  # Execute plan
```
