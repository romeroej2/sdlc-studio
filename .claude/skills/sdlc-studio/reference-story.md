## Story Workflows

## /sdlc-studio story - Step by Step {#story-workflow}

1. **Check Prerequisites**
   - Check sdlc-studio/personas.md exists
     - If missing: create from template, ask user to populate, STOP
   - Check sdlc-studio/epics/ has epic files
     - If empty: prompt to run `/sdlc-studio epic` first, STOP
   - Create sdlc-studio/stories/ if needed
   - Scan for existing stories to determine next ID

2. **Parse Inputs**
   - Read personas (name, role, goals, pain points)
   - Read Epic(s) to process
   - For each Epic, extract:
     - Acceptance criteria
     - Scope
     - Affected personas
     - Technical considerations

3. **Break Down into Stories**
   For each Epic:
   - Identify atomic user actions
   - Apply heuristics:
     - One story per distinct action
     - Completable in one sprint
     - Split by persona when relevant
   - For each story:
     a. Select most relevant persona
     b. Write "As a... I want... So that..."
     c. Generate 3-5 Given/When/Then criteria
     d. Identify edge cases
     e. Leave Story Points as {{TBD}}
     f. **Detect cross-story dependencies** (see step 3b)
     g. **Emit best-effort `Verify:` lines.** For each AC, write a
        Verify expression matching the AC intent:
        - API story with HTTP contract -> `http METHOD /path -- <jq>`
        - Behavioural unit test -> `pytest|jest|vitest <node_or_pattern>`
        - File or symbol presence -> `file <path>` or `grep <regex> <path>`
        - Nothing reasonable -> leave Verify line off (manual verification)
        Mark `Verified: no` on every AC until reconcile runs. See
        `reference-verify.md#verify-dsl` for the DSL table and
        `reference-verify.md#verify-writing-good` for guidance on
        writing verifiers that are deterministic, fast, and narrow.

3b. **Detect Cross-Story Dependencies (MANDATORY)**

   Automatically identify dependencies between stories:

   a) **Schema Dependencies:**
      - Scan story for config schemas, data models, or types
      - Check if any schema is defined in another story
      - If found, add to Schema Dependencies table

   b) **API Dependencies:**
      - Scan story for API endpoint consumption
      - Check if endpoint is defined in another story
      - If found, add to API Dependencies table

   c) **Service Dependencies:**
      - Scan story for service/function calls
      - Check if service is defined in another story
      - If found, add to Story Dependencies table

   d) **Populate story template sections:**

      <!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
      ```markdown
      ### Story Dependencies
      | Story | Dependency Type | What's Needed | Status |
      |-------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
      | US0013 | Schema | NotificationsConfig | Done |

      ### Schema Dependencies
      | Schema | Source Story | Fields Needed |
      |--------|--------------|---------------|
      | NotificationsConfig | US0013 | slack_webhook_url, notify_on_critical |

      ### API Dependencies
      | Endpoint | Source Story | How Used |
      |----------|--------------|----------|
      | GET /api/settings | US0023 | Fetch user preferences |
      ```
      <!-- markdownlint-enable MD046 -->

   e) **Warn if dependent story not Done:**
      ```text
      > **Warning:** This story depends on stories that are not Done:
      > - US0013: Slack Notifications (In Progress)
      ```

1. **Generate Story Files**
   - Assign ID: US{NNNN} (global)
   - Create slug (kebab-case)
   - Use `templates/core/story.md`
   - Link to parent Epic

2. **Update Epic Files**
   - Add story links to Story Breakdown section
   - Update Estimated Story Count

3. **Write Files**
   - Write `sdlc-studio/stories/US{NNNN}-{slug}.md`
   - Create/update `sdlc-studio/stories/_index.md`
   - Update modified Epic files

4. **Report**
   - Stories created per Epic
   - Full story list
   - Criteria that couldn't be converted

5. **Run Cohesion Review (Automatic)**
   - See [Story Cohesion Review](#story-cohesion-review) below
   - Validates generated stories collectively cover the epic
   - Reports gaps, sizing issues, overlaps
   - Auto-fixes where possible

6. **Three Amigos Consultation (Default)**
   Unless `--skip-personas` flag used, run Three Amigos review on all generated stories:

   **Per-epic batch:** For each epic's stories, consult all three amigos:

   a. **Sarah Chen (PM) reviews each story for:**
      - User value clarity in "As a... I want... So that..."
      - AC completeness against epic requirements
      - Success metrics alignment
      - Scope boundaries (nothing missing, nothing extra)

   b. **Marcus Johnson (Eng) reviews each story for:**
      - TRD alignment (API contracts, data models, architecture patterns)
      - Technical notes accuracy and feasibility
      - Dependency correctness (cross-story and cross-epic)
      - Implementation guidance clarity

   c. **Priya Sharma (QA) reviews each story for:**
      - AC testability (Given/When/Then precision)
      - Edge case completeness against TSD risk profile
      - Test scenario coverage adequacy
      - Multi-tenancy isolation considerations

   **Process:**
   - Run consultations in parallel (one agent per epic)
   - Each agent reviews all stories in its epic from all three perspectives
   - Apply improvements directly to story files where feedback is actionable
   - Add persona attribution to revision history for changes made
   - Report summary of findings, changes applied, and items needing user decision

   **Output:** Append to each story's revision history:

   ```text
   | {date} | Three Amigos | Persona consultation: {summary of changes} |
   ```

## Story Cohesion Review (Post-Generation) {#story-cohesion-review}

Automatic review that runs as the final step of story generation. Ensures stories collectively cover the epic requirements.

### Trigger

Runs automatically after `story generate --epic EP0001`. No separate command needed.

### Cohesion Checks

| Check | Description | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AC Coverage** | Every epic AC maps to at least one story AC | Critical |
| **Edge Cases** | All epic edge cases distributed across stories | Important |
| **Dependencies** | Story dependencies form valid DAG (no cycles) | Critical |
| **Sizing** | No story too large (> 13 points or > 10 AC) | Important |
| **Overlaps** | No duplicate AC across multiple stories | Suggestion |
| **Gaps** | No epic requirements left unaddressed | Critical |

### Cohesion Review Workflow {#cohesion-workflow}

```text
1. Gather Generated Stories
   - Load all stories just created for epic
   - Build story-to-AC mapping

2. Check AC Coverage
   - Parse epic AC list
   - For each epic AC: find matching story AC
   - Flag any epic AC with no story coverage

3. Check Edge Cases
   - Parse epic edge cases
   - For each: find story that handles it
   - Flag unhandled edge cases

4. Check Dependencies
   - Build dependency graph from story deps
   - Detect cycles (error if found)
   - Check schema/API deps have source stories

5. Check Sizing
   - Flag stories with > 13 points
   - Flag stories with > 10 AC
   - Suggest splitting if found

6. Check Overlaps
   - Compare AC text across stories
   - Flag similar AC in different stories
   - Suggest consolidation if overlap > 70%

7. Report & Auto-Fix
   - Display cohesion summary
   - If issues found:
     - Critical: Missing AC coverage, cycles
     - Important: Sizing issues, edge case gaps
     - Suggestion: Overlaps, dependency optimisations
   - Apply auto-fixes where safe
   - Update epic with discovered gaps
```

### Cohesion Report Output {#cohesion-output}

Displayed after story generation completes:

```text
## Story Cohesion Review: EP0001

Generated 6 stories for "User Authentication"

### AC Coverage                    ✅ 100%
All 12 epic AC mapped to story AC

### Edge Cases                     ⚠️ 1 gap
- "Rate limiting bypass" not covered → Added to US0006

### Dependencies                   ✅ Valid
No cycles, all deps have sources

### Sizing                         ⚠️ 1 flag
- US0003 has 14 AC → Consider splitting

### Overlaps                       ✅ None
No duplicate AC detected

### Actions Taken
- Added edge case to US0006
- Updated EP0001 open questions with sizing concern
```

### Auto-Fix Behaviour {#cohesion-auto-fix}

| Issue | Auto-Fix | Manual Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missing edge case | Add to most relevant story | None needed |
| Missing AC coverage | Add as open question on epic | User must assign to story |
| Cycle detected | Report error, no auto-fix | User must resolve |
| Oversized story | Add splitting suggestion to story | User decides whether to split |
| Overlapping AC | Report only, no auto-fix | User consolidates if needed |

### Cohesion Findings Storage {#cohesion-storage}

Cohesion review results are stored as part of the review findings system:

- **Location:** `sdlc-studio/reviews/RV{NNNN}-{epic-id}-cohesion.md`
- **Template:** `templates/review-findings-template.md` (cohesion section)
- **State tracking:** Updated in `sdlc-studio/.local/review-state.json`

---

## /sdlc-studio story review - Step by Step {#story-review-workflow}

1. **Load Stories**
   - Read all from sdlc-studio/stories/
   - Parse acceptance criteria and DoD items

2. **Analyse Implementation**
   For each story, use Task tool with Explore agent:

   ```text
   For story [Title], check implementation:
   1. Code matching acceptance criteria
   2. Relevant test files
   3. API/UI implementation
   4. Documentation updates
   Assess: Which criteria are met?
   ```

3. **Update Story Files**
   - Update Status field
   - Check off completed criteria
   - Check off applicable DoD items
   - Add revision history entry
   - **"Done" rules:**
     - If all AC and DoD items met → suggest "Done" (user confirms)
     - "Done" is always a user decision, never auto-assigned
     - Prompt user: "All criteria complete. Mark story as Done? [y/N]"
     - **If user confirms Done:** Execute the **Story Completion Cascade** immediately.
       > **Canonical checklist:** `reference-outputs.md` → [Story Completion Cascade](reference-outputs.md#story-completion-cascade)

4. **Update Related Files**
   - Update _index.md with status counts
   - Check if Epic should be reviewed

5. **Report**
   - Stories completed
   - Stories in progress
   - Stories blocked
   - Regressions

## /sdlc-studio story generate - Step by Step (Specification Extraction) {#story-generate-workflow}

**Purpose:** Extract detailed, testable specifications from existing code. The output must be detailed enough that another team could rebuild the system without seeing the original code.

**See `reference-philosophy.md` for the full philosophy on Create vs Generate modes.**

1. **Check Prerequisites**
   - Check sdlc-studio/personas.md exists
   - Check sdlc-studio/epics/ has epic files for scope
   - Create sdlc-studio/stories/ if needed
   - Scan for existing stories to determine next ID

2. **Read Epic for Scope**
   - Load the target Epic(s)
   - Extract: features to cover, affected endpoints, components

3. **Deep Code Exploration**
   Use Task tool with Explore agent:

   ```text
   For Epic [Title], extract implementation specifications:

   1. Find all implementing code (routes, services, models)
   2. For each endpoint/function:
      - Exact request/response shapes
      - All validation rules with actual error messages
      - Edge cases handled in code
      - Default values and limits
   3. Document actual behaviour, not assumed behaviour

   Return: Structured specification per feature
   ```

4. **Generate Implementation-Ready Stories**
   For each feature identified:

   a. **Write precise AC** - not "returns data" but exact shapes:

      ```text
      - Given an engram exists with slug "test-person"
      - When I GET /engrams/test-person
      - Then I receive 200 with JSON containing:
        - slug: "test-person"
        - name: string (extracted from engram file)
        - role: string
        - category: "fictional" or "real"
        - el_rating: string or null
        - engram_content: string (full .engram file)
        - psychometrics: object or null
        - user_manual: string or null
        - labels: array of strings
      ```

   b. **Document all edge cases** with specific inputs and outputs:

      ```text
      | Scenario | Input | Expected |
      |----------|-------|----------|
      | Not found | GET /engrams/nonexistent | 404, {"detail": "Engram not found: nonexistent"} |
      | Invalid slug chars | GET /engrams/has spaces | 404 or 422 depending on routing |
      ```

   c. **Extract actual validation rules** from code:
      - What fields are required?
      - What are the length limits?
      - What values are allowed?
      - What are the exact error messages?

   d. **Document API contracts precisely**:
      - Request method, path, headers required
      - Request body schema with types
      - Response codes and their meanings
      - Response body schemas for each code

5. **Set Status to Ready (NOT Done)**
   - Generated specs await validation
   - Done only after tests pass against implementation

6. **Write Story Files**
   - Use `templates/core/story.md`
   - Include exhaustive edge case tables
   - Include precise API contracts
   - Link to parent Epic

7. **Update Registries**
   - Update `sdlc-studio/stories/_index.md`
   - Update Epic with story links

8. **Report with Next Steps**
   - Stories generated
   - Remind: specs are NOT validated until tests pass
   - Suggest: `/sdlc-studio test-spec --epic EP00XX` next

**Quality Checklist for Generated Stories:**

- [ ] AC detailed enough to implement without seeing original code
- [ ] All edge cases documented with specific inputs/outputs
- [ ] API contracts include exact request/response shapes
- [ ] Error scenarios include actual error messages from code
- [ ] No ambiguous language ("handles errors", "returns data")
- [ ] Validation rules extracted from actual code

## Story Quality Enforcement

Before marking a story as Ready, verify it meets minimum standards.

> **Ready criteria:** `reference-decisions.md` → Story Ready

## Story Ready Validation (Enforced) {#ready-validation}

Stories CANNOT be marked Ready unless they meet these enforced minimums:

### API Stories {#api-stories}

| Requirement | Minimum | Enforcement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Edge cases documented | 8 | Count `\| Scenario` rows in edge case table |
| Test scenarios listed | 10 | Count `- [ ]` items in Test Scenarios section |
| Given/When/Then concrete | All AC | No placeholders or TBD |
| Error codes specified | All errors | Each error has code and message |
| Open questions resolved | All critical | No unresolved critical questions |

### UI Stories {#ui-stories}

| Requirement | Minimum | Enforcement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Edge cases documented | 5 | Count `\| Scenario` rows |
| Test scenarios listed | 8 | Count `- [ ]` items |
| UI states documented | All | Loading, error, empty, success |
| Accessibility noted | Required | Screen reader, keyboard nav |
| Open questions resolved | All critical | No unresolved critical |

### Validation Algorithm {#validation-algorithm}

```python
def validate_story_ready(story):
    errors = []

    # Count edge cases
    edge_cases = count_table_rows(story, "Edge Cases")
    min_edge_cases = 8 if story.is_api else 5
    if edge_cases < min_edge_cases:
        errors.append(f"Edge cases: {edge_cases}/{min_edge_cases} (need {min_edge_cases - edge_cases} more)")

    # Count test scenarios
    test_scenarios = count_checkboxes(story, "Test Scenarios")
    min_scenarios = 10 if story.is_api else 8
    if test_scenarios < min_scenarios:
        errors.append(f"Test scenarios: {test_scenarios}/{min_scenarios}")

    # Check for placeholders
    if contains_placeholder(story.acceptance_criteria):
        errors.append("AC contains TBD or placeholder text")

    # Check critical open questions
    critical_questions = get_unresolved_critical(story.open_questions)
    if critical_questions:
        errors.append(f"Unresolved critical questions: {len(critical_questions)}")

    # Check ambiguous language
    ambiguous = detect_ambiguous_language(story)
    if ambiguous:
        errors.append(f"Ambiguous language found: {', '.join(ambiguous)}")

    return errors
```

### Validation Output {#validation-output}

When attempting to mark a story Ready:

```markdown
## Story Ready Validation: US0024

### Status: BLOCKED

Cannot mark Ready - the following requirements are not met:

| Requirement | Current | Required | Gap |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----|
| Edge cases | 5 | 8 | Need 3 more |
| Test scenarios | 7 | 10 | Need 3 more |
| Critical questions | 2 unresolved | 0 | Resolve or downgrade |

### Ambiguous Language Detected

The following phrases should be made specific:

| Location | Phrase | Suggestion |
|----------|--------|------------|
| AC2 | "handles errors" | Specify which errors and how |
| Edge Case 3 | "returns appropriate response" | Specify exact response |

### Actions Required

1. Add 3 more edge cases to Edge Cases table
2. Add 3 more test scenarios to Test Scenarios section
3. Resolve or downgrade critical open questions
4. Replace ambiguous language with specific behaviour
```

## Quality Checklist {#quality-checklist}

### All Stories {#all-stories}

- [ ] No ambiguous language ("handles errors", "returns data", "works correctly")
- [ ] All Open Questions have target resolution dates
- [ ] Critical Open Questions resolved before Ready status
- [ ] Given/When/Then uses concrete values, not placeholders
- [ ] Persona referenced with specific context (not just name)

## Blocking Conditions {#blocking-conditions}

**Do NOT mark Ready if:**

| Condition | Why It Blocks |
| --- | --- |
| Critical Open Question unresolved | Specification incomplete |
| Edge case count below 8 (API stories) | Test coverage will have gaps |
| API contracts use vague language | Implementer will make assumptions |
| "TBD" still in acceptance criteria | Story is not actually ready |
| No error scenarios documented | Happy-path-only specification |

## Ambiguous Language Detection {#ambiguous-language-detection}

> **Source of truth:** `reference-decisions.md` → Ambiguous Language Detection

These phrases indicate specification gaps. Replace before marking Ready.

## Quality Metrics {#quality-metrics}

Track story quality across the project:

```text
/sdlc-studio status --quality

Story Quality:
  Total: 24 stories
  Ready: 18 (12 high-quality, 6 need improvement)
  Draft: 6

  Edge case coverage: 85% meet minimum
  Ambiguous language: 3 stories flagged
  Open Questions: 2 unresolved critical
```

## User Story Section Reference
>
> **Section-by-section guidance:** See `reference-story-sections.md` for detailed guidance on completing each section of the story template (User Story statement, Context, AC, Scope, UI/UX, Technical Notes, Edge Cases, Test Scenarios, DoD, Estimation).

---

## Workflow Commands

Automated workflows for complete story implementation.

These commands operate on a single story. For autonomous epic-level execution with concurrent waves, see `reference-epic.md#flag-agentic`.

## /sdlc-studio story plan - Step by Step {#story-plan-workflow}

1. **Validate Story Ready**
   - Load story file from sdlc-studio/stories/
   - Check status is Ready (not Draft, Planned, or Done)
   - Verify all Ready criteria met (see reference-decisions.md):
     - All AC in Given/When/Then format
     - No TBD or placeholder text
     - Edge cases complete (minimum 8 for API, 5 for others)
     - No ambiguous language
     - Critical Open Questions resolved

2. **Check Dependencies**
   - Parse story Dependencies section
   - For each dependent story, verify status is Done
   - If any dependency not Done, report warning:

     ```text
     > **Warning:** This story depends on stories that are not Done:
     > - US0013: Slack Notifications (In Progress)
     ```

3. **Determine Approach**
   Apply TDD decision tree from reference-decisions.md:

| | Factor | TDD | Test-After |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Edge cases >5 | Yes | |
| | Clear AC | Yes | |
| | API story | Yes | |
| | UI-heavy | | Yes |
| | Exploratory | | Yes |
| | Complex business rules | Yes | |

   Document rationale for approach selection.

1. **Create Implementation Plan (MANDATORY)**
   - Run `code plan --story US000X` internally
   - Write plan file to `sdlc-studio/plans/PL{NNNN}-{slug}.md`
   - **STOP if file creation fails** - do not proceed without written plan
   - Store plan ID for workflow tracking

2. **Create Test Specification (MANDATORY)**
   - Run `test-spec --story US000X` internally
   - Write spec file to `sdlc-studio/test-specs/TS{NNNN}-{slug}.md`
   - **STOP if file creation fails** - do not proceed without written spec
   - Store spec ID for workflow tracking

3. **Review Created Artifacts with User**
   Present the created artifacts for user review:

   ```text
   ## Story Workflow Plan: US0024

   **Story:** Action Queue API Endpoint
   **Status:** Ready → Planned
   **Dependencies:** US0023 (Done)

   ### Artifacts Created

   | Artifact | Path | Status |
   |----------|------|--------|
   | Implementation Plan | sdlc-studio/plans/PL0024-action-queue-api.md | ✅ Created |
   | Test Specification | sdlc-studio/test-specs/TS0024-action-queue-api.md | ✅ Created |

   ### Approach: TDD
   Reason: API story with 8 edge cases, clear Given/When/Then AC

   ### Execution Phases

   | Phase | Command | Artifacts |
   |-------|---------|-----------|
   | 1. Plan | ✅ Complete | PL0024-action-queue-api.md |
   | 2. Test Spec | ✅ Complete | TS0024-action-queue-api.md |
   | 3. Tests | test-automation | tests/test_action_queue_api.py |
   | 4. Implement | code implement | src/api/action_queue.py |
   | 5. Test | code test | Run tests |
   | 6. Verify | code verify | Verify against AC |
   | 7. Check | code check | Quality gates |
   | 8. Review | status | Final status review |

   Review the plan and test-spec files. Ready to continue?
   Run: /sdlc-studio story implement --story US0024
   ```

   **CRITICAL:** Steps 4 and 5 MUST complete with files written to disk before showing this review. If no files exist, the workflow has failed.

---

## /sdlc-studio story implement - Step by Step {#story-implement-workflow}

### Agentic Mode Behaviour {#agentic-override}

When called from `epic implement --agentic` or `project implement --agentic`, the workflow adapts based on whether `--no-artifacts` is active:

**Default agentic (without `--no-artifacts`):**

- All 8 phases run, but agents execute phases 1-4 in a single prompt (plan + test-spec + tests + implement together)
- **Plan file (PL) IS created** - lightweight, written before agent launches
- **Test spec file (TS) IS created** - alongside plan
- **Workflow file (WF) IS created** - tracks phase progress for resumability
- Status transitions: Ready -> Planned -> In Progress -> Done (full flow)
- **Reconcile runs after each wave** to prevent drift

**With `--no-artifacts`:**

- **Skip phases 1-2:** Plan and test-spec files are not created. The agent prompt contains all plan/test-spec content inline (story AC, TRD context, codebase patterns, file scope).
- **Skip phase 8:** Formal review phase is not run. Quality is enforced at wave boundaries instead.
- **Workflow file not created.** Epic-level or project-level state tracking suffices.
- **Status transitions compressed:** Story goes Ready -> Done directly.
- **Reconcile still runs after each wave** to keep indexes and dependency tables in sync.

**In both modes, quality gates are enforced at wave boundaries:**

- Typecheck must pass
- Full test suite must pass
- Reconcile runs (scoped to wave's stories)

The full 8-phase sequential workflow below applies when NOT in agentic mode (i.e. `story implement` called directly).

---

1. **Check for Existing Workflow State (MANDATORY RESUME CHECK)**

   **CRITICAL:** Before starting any work, check if this story has an existing workflow:

   a. Search for workflow file: `sdlc-studio/workflows/WF*-{story-slug}.md`

   b. **If workflow exists:**
      - Read the workflow state file
      - Check "Current Phase" and "Phase Progress" table
      - Identify last completed phase and any errors
      - Report resume status to user:

        ```text
        ## Resuming Workflow: WF0024

        **Story:** US0024 - Action Queue API
        **Last Session:** 2026-01-27
        **Completed Phases:** 1-3 (Plan, Test Spec, Implement)
        **Resume From:** Phase 4 (Tests)

        Continuing from where we left off...
        ```

      - Skip to the first incomplete phase

   c. **If no workflow exists:**
      - Create new workflow file from `templates/core/workflow.md`
      - Write to `sdlc-studio/workflows/WF{NNNN}-{story-slug}.md`
      - Assign next available workflow ID
      - **STOP if file creation fails** - do not proceed without workflow state

   d. **If `--from-phase N` specified:**
      - Override resume point to phase N
      - Update workflow state to reflect manual override

2. **Validate Prerequisites (STOP if any fail)**

   a. **Check story exists and has correct status:**
      - Story file must exist in `sdlc-studio/stories/`
      - Status must be Planned or In Progress
      - If status is Ready/Draft: **STOP** - plan not created yet

   b. **Check plan file exists (MANDATORY):**
      - Search for `sdlc-studio/plans/PL*-{story-slug}.md`
      - **If plan does NOT exist, STOP immediately:**

        ```text
        ## Cannot Proceed - No Plan Found

        **Story:** US0024 - Action Queue API
        **Status:** Ready

        A plan must be created before implementation can begin.
        The plan defines implementation tasks, approach, and provides
        an audit trail for the work.

        ### To Create a Plan
        Run: /sdlc-studio story plan --story US0024

        This will:
        1. Create the implementation plan (PL0024)
        2. Create the test specification (TS0024)
        3. Update story status to Planned
        4. Present artifacts for review

        Then run: /sdlc-studio story implement --story US0024
        ```

   c. **Check test spec file exists:**
      - Search for `sdlc-studio/test-specs/TS*-{story-slug}.md`
      - If missing but plan exists: warn but allow to continue
        (test spec can be created during workflow)

   d. **Check dependencies:**
      - Dependencies met (or acknowledged if resuming)
      - No unresolved blocking errors in workflow state

3. **Apply Approach Override**
   - If `--tdd` flag: use TDD phase order
   - If `--no-tdd` flag: use Test-After phase order
   - Otherwise: use approach from plan's "Recommended Approach" section

4. **Execute Phases (with Progress Tracking)**

   For each phase (starting from resume point):

   a. **Update workflow state BEFORE starting phase:**
      - Set phase status to "In Progress"
      - Record start timestamp
      - Write workflow file to disk

   b. **Execute phase command:**
| | Phase | Command | Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 1 | `code plan --story US000X` | Plan file |
| | 2 | `test-spec --story US000X` | Test spec file |
| | 3 | `code implement --plan PL000X` | Source files |
| | 4 | `test-automation --spec TS000X` | Test files |
| | 5 | `code test --story US000X` | Test results |
| | 6 | `code verify --story US000X` | AC verification |
| | 7 | `code check` | Lint results |
| | 8 | Review | Final status |

   c. **Update plan checkboxes (MANDATORY for Phase 3):**
      During implementation (Phase 3), as each task completes:
      - Read the plan file
      - Find the task in "Implementation Tasks" table
      - Change `[ ]` to `[x]`
      - Write the plan file
      - Update workflow state with task completion

      Example plan update:

      ```markdown
      | 1 | Add isPaused prop to StatusLED | `StatusLED.tsx` | - | [x] |
      | 2 | Add paused state styling | `StatusLED.tsx` | 1 | [x] |
      | 3 | Import Wrench icon | `ServerCard.tsx` | - | [ ] |  ← next task
      ```

   d. **Update workflow state AFTER phase completes:**
      - Set phase status to "Done" (success) or "Paused" (failure)
      - Record completion timestamp
      - Record any notes or errors
      - Update "Current Phase" pointer
      - Add session log entry
      - Write workflow file to disk

5. **Handle Phase Errors (with State Preservation)**

   When a phase fails:

   a. **Update workflow state immediately:**
      - Set phase status to "Paused"
      - Record error message in "Errors & Pauses" section
      - Set workflow status to "Paused"
      - Write workflow file to disk

   b. **Report error with resume path:**

      ```text
      ## Workflow Paused

      **Story:** US0024 - Action Queue API
      **Phase:** 5. Test
      **Error:** 2 tests failed

      ### Failed Tests
      - test_action_queue_empty: Expected 200, got 500
      - test_action_invalid_id: AssertionError

      ### State Saved
      Workflow state saved to: sdlc-studio/workflows/WF0024-action-queue-api.md
      Plan progress saved: 6/8 tasks complete

      ### To Resume
      1. Fix the failing tests or implementation
      2. Run: /sdlc-studio story implement --story US0024
         (Will automatically resume from Phase 5)

      Or to skip to next phase:
         /sdlc-studio story implement --story US0024 --from-phase 6
      ```

6. **Complete Workflow (with Full State Update)**

   When all phases pass:

   a. **Update all artifact statuses (Status Cascade):**
      This is the most critical step. Execute the **Story Completion Cascade** for the story being completed.

      > **Canonical checklist:** `reference-outputs.md` → [Story Completion Cascade](reference-outputs.md#story-completion-cascade)

      Follow all steps: update plan, update test spec, update workflow, recalculate index counts, check epic status, document reason (for non-Done terminals), update story index entries, update epic story breakdown, update downstream dependency tables, tick test scenario checkboxes, and cascade epic completion if applicable. The story itself should be updated to Done (or the appropriate terminal status if the workflow was terminated early).

      > **Why this is critical:** Without this cascade, plan and test spec files accumulate stale statuses (Draft/Ready/In Progress) while the story shows Done. This creates misleading dashboard output. Every story terminal status MUST cascade to all linked artifacts.

   b. **Verify plan task completion:**
      - Read plan file
      - Check all tasks have `[x]`
      - If any unchecked, report warning

   c. **Update workflow completion section:**
      - Record completion date
      - Calculate total duration
      - List all artifacts created

   d. **Report completion with audit trail:**

      ```text
      ## Workflow Complete

      **Story:** US0024 - Action Queue API
      **Workflow:** WF0024
      **Duration:** 45 minutes (across 2 sessions)
      **Approach:** TDD

      ### Phase Summary

## Workflow Error Handling {#workflow-error-handling}

### Phase-Specific Errors {#phase-specific-errors}

| Phase | Error | Cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Plan | Story not Ready | Missing Ready criteria | Complete story preparation |
| 1. Plan | Dependency not Done | Blocking story incomplete | Complete dependency first |
| 2. Test Spec | AC coverage gap | AC not testable | Clarify AC in story |
| 3. Tests | Generation fails | Test framework issue | Check framework config |
| 4. Implement | Syntax error | Code bug | Fix code |
| 5. Test | Tests fail | Implementation bug | Fix implementation |
| 6. Verify | AC not met | Missing functionality | Address verification issues |
| 7. Check | Lint errors | Style violations | Run auto-fix or manual fix |
| 8. Review | Status issues | Gaps in coverage/quality | Address before marking done |

### Recovery Strategies {#story-recovery-strategies}

**Option 1: Fix and Resume**

```bash
# Fix the issue manually
# Then resume from failed phase
/sdlc-studio story implement --story US0024 --from-phase 5
```

**Option 2: Skip Phase**

```bash
# Manual phase execution
/sdlc-studio code test --story US0024
# Then resume
/sdlc-studio story implement --story US0024 --from-phase 6
```

**Option 3: Restart Workflow**

```bash
# Delete workflow file and start fresh
rm sdlc-studio/workflows/WF0024-action-queue-api.md
/sdlc-studio story implement --story US0024
```
