## Typical Workflows

### Quick Start

```text
/sdlc-studio hint                # Get suggested next step
/sdlc-studio status              # See full pipeline state
```

### Greenfield Project (Manual)

```text
/sdlc-studio prd create
/sdlc-studio trd create
/sdlc-studio persona
/sdlc-studio epic
/sdlc-studio story
/sdlc-studio tsd
/sdlc-studio test-spec
/sdlc-studio test-automation
```

Per-story you choose TDD or Test-After. Both paths produce the same artifacts, in different order:

```text

PRD → TRD → Personas → Epics → Stories
                                  │
                    ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
                    │                           │
              TDD Path                    Test-After Path
              (test-first)                (code-first)
                    │                           │
              test-spec                    code plan
                    │                           │
              code plan                   code implement
                    │                           │
         code implement --tdd              test-spec
                    │                           │
              code verify                 test-automation
                    │                           │
              code test                     code verify
                                                │
                                            code test
```

### Brownfield Project (Manual)

```text
/sdlc-studio prd generate
/sdlc-studio trd generate
/sdlc-studio persona generate
/sdlc-studio epic
/sdlc-studio story
/sdlc-studio tsd generate
/sdlc-studio test-spec generate
/sdlc-studio test-automation
```

Flow: `prd generate → trd generate → persona generate → epic → story generate → test-spec → test-automation → code test (VALIDATE)`

**Critical:** The `code test` step validates specs against reality. Not optional.

### Automated Workflow (Recommended)

At story level:

```text

PRD → TRD → Personas → Epics → Stories
                                  │
                          story plan --story US0001
                                  │
                          story implement --story US0001
                                  │
                          (all 8 phases run automatically)
```

Or at the epic level with autonomous execution:

```text

epic plan --epic EP0001 --agentic
        │
(analyses dependencies → assigns concurrent waves)
        │
epic implement --epic EP0001 --agentic
        │
Wave 1: [US0001, US0003] concurrent
Wave 2: [US0002, US0004] concurrent
Wave 3: [US0005] sequential (hub file conflict)
```

`--agentic` analyses the dependency graph and hub file overlap to identify stories that can safely execute concurrently. Falls back to sequential for any stories with shared file conflicts.

**Workflow phases per story:**

1. Plan (code plan)
2. Test Spec (test-spec)
3. Tests (test-automation)
4. Implement (code implement)
5. Test (code test)
6. Verify (code verify)
7. Check (code check)
8. Review (status review)

### Project Implementation (Full PRD)

```text
/sdlc-studio project plan --agentic              # Preview execution order
/sdlc-studio project implement --agentic --no-artifacts  # Implement all epics
```

```text

project implement --agentic --no-artifacts
        │
EP0001: epic implement --agentic → commit → reconcile
EP0002: epic implement --agentic → commit → reconcile
EP0003: epic implement --agentic → commit → reconcile → review (every 3 epics)
...
Final: review → reconcile → report
```

**Quality gates enforced at every boundary:**

- Wave: typecheck + test suite
- Epic: reconcile + status cascade + commit
- Every 3 epics: quick review
- Project: full review + reconcile + code check

See `reference-project.md` for the full workflow.

### Epic Implementation

```text
/sdlc-studio epic plan --epic EP0002 --agentic   # Preview wave analysis
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0002 --agentic  # Implement one epic
```

### Story Implementation

```text
/sdlc-studio story plan --story US0001           # Create plan + test-spec
/sdlc-studio story implement --story US0001      # Execute 8-phase workflow
```

### Development Cycle (Manual)

```text
/sdlc-studio code plan           # Plan story (status -> Planned)
/sdlc-studio code implement      # Execute plan (status -> In Progress)
/sdlc-studio code test           # Run tests
/sdlc-studio code verify         # Verify AC (status -> Review)
/sdlc-studio code check          # Run linters (status -> Done)
```

Status: `Draft/Ready → Planned → In Progress → Review → Done`

### Daily Usage

```text
/sdlc-studio hint                # What should I do next?
/sdlc-studio status              # Full pipeline overview
/sdlc-studio status --brief      # Quick: Requirements 85% | Code 90% | Tests 94%
/sdlc-studio code plan           # Plan next story
```
